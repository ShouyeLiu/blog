The paper Ivan Smith and I wrote on Lagrangian pinwheels in
\(\mathbf{CP}^2\) and Markov numbers has recently appeared in <i>Geometry
and Topology</i>. Shortly thereafter, Yong-Geun Oh contacted us with some
excellent questions where our exposition was less than clear. In case
anyone else has the same questions, I thought I would write a blog post
clarifying these points.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lemma 2.16(c) should say \(T=\mathbb{Z}/(m)\) rather than
\(\mathbb{Z}/(\Delta/m)\).
</li>
<li>There is a discrepancy between what we write in Section 2.3:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>``The generic orbit is homologous to \(p^2e/g\).'' (correct)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
and what we write in the final paragraph of Remark 3.15:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>``the generic Reeb orbits are homologically trivial in
\(\Sigma_{p,q}\)'' (not true in general)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Indeed, since \(H_1(\Sigma_{p,q};\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}/(p^2)\), this
only holds when \(g=1\), which happens if and only if \(p\) is odd (see
Remark 2.12).
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is important, because Remark 3.15 is used to justify why certain
holomorphic curves asymptote to nongeneric Reeb orbits. As stated, the
argument we give there holds only for odd \(p\).
</p>

<p>
I will now explain the two situations in which we needed this fact and
how it generalises to arbitrary values of \(p\). In the case when \(p\) is
odd (and \(g=1\)), this reduces to what we wrote.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In Theorem 4.16, we have a holomorphic cylinder which we have
extracted from an SFT neck-stretching argument. One of its ends is
asymptotic to a Reeb orbit on a component of the boundary called
\(\Sigma_{p_2,q_2}\) (a contact lens space). We have already
established that the Reeb orbits fall into two categories:
``exceptional'' and ``generic'' (the Reeb orbits give a Seifert
fibration of the lens space). <b>We want to show that this asymptote
is to an exceptional orbit.</b>

<p>
The homology class of the generic orbit is \(p^2/g\) times the class
of the exceptional orbit. The relative homology class of the
cylinder is (in notation from the paper) \(D\mathcal{E}\) and the
connecting homomorphism to
\(H_1(\Sigma_{p_2,q_2};\mathbf{Z})=\mathbf{Z}/(p_2^2)\) is to reduce
\(D\) modulo \(p_2^2\). We know that \(D\leq p_2/3\) by Lemma 4.11(B). If
the asymptote were generic then \(D\) would reduce modulo \(p_2^2\) to
something divisible by \(p_2^2/g\) (where \(g\) is \(1\), \(2\) or \(4\),
depending on \(p_2\) by Remark 2.12). But then we get \(p_2^2/g\leq
   p_2/3\), which implies \(p_2\leq g/3\leq 4/3\) so we don't need to
worry about this case as \(p_2\) is at least \(2\).
</p>
</li>

<li>In the other situation, if the SFT limit is a plane (the case
\(|Z|=1\) in the paper) and the asymptote is generic then the
homology class of the plane is, again, divisible by \(p^2/g\) and
this contradicts the inequality \(D\leq 2p/3\) from Lemma 4.8.
