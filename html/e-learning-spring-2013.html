Henry Wilton, Bonita Carboo and I are the UCL Maths Department's
e-learning reps. In the interests of sharing ideas, here are a few
things I have discovered this Spring about e-learning which may be
useful to others.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Moodle.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Moodle is the online platform UCL uses to interact with its
students. I am only just waking up to the possibilities it offers.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly for mathematicians, Moodle has LaTeX
functionality. You may not discover it immediately, because the syntax
is a little strange: you need to surround your LaTeX by double dollar
signs, e.g. $$\sin(x)$$. This acts as if it were single dollar signs
in ordinary LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
I was initially unconvinced of the utility of online forums for
students, but that changed drastically. I had a feeling that students
wouldn’t use them, but I decided to give it a go. I was being asked
many questions by email, many of which were duplicates, so I created a
forum for the students to ask questions during exam term. If I was
emailed a question, I didn’t answer it and instead strongly encouraged
the student to ask on the Moodle forum. The result was a big uptake of
the forum with sixteen threads involving posts from sixteen different
students in the month leading up to the exam. This is only 10% of the
class, but I was able to point others who asked questions by email to
the answers I had posted on the forum, saving me time. If I had
realised earlier how effective this would be, I would have introduced
a forum from the outset.
</p>

<p>
You can see stats on how many views your forum is getting by going to
Navigation &gt; Reports &gt; Logs (thanks to Fiona Harkin for pointing this
out). The revision forum had had 2491 views in just over a month. I
would say this has been an extremely effective tool: while it was a
lot of work to answer all the questions, that work counted for more.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Sage</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
<a href="http://www.sagemath.org/index.html">Sage</a> is an open-source computer algebra program. You can run it online
<del>using the Sage Notebook if you have an OpenID or</del> using the <a href="http://aleph.sagemath.org/">Sage Cell
Server</a> which allows you to run small scripts without the bother of
signing in. You can even embed it into webpages to create interactive
content.
</p>

<p>
One of the biggest problems my students had was getting practice
calculating Fourier series, so I have written the bare bones of a
short (easily extendable) interactive webpage for next year which
should give them the practice they need. I will add more examples to
this (if and) when I have time. If you want to see how the page works,
you can see the Sage code embedded in the HTML by viewing the page
source. The important things are the script tags in the document head.

<h3 id="sec-1-3">E-learning development grant</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
I am now the proud owner of an e-learning development grant to
facilitate the filming of mathematics lectures and make them available
online. For more information, see my <a href="./eldg.html">blog post here</a>.
