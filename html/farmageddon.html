I have just finished reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Farmageddon-True-Cost-Cheap-Meat/dp/1408846446#immersive-view_1517664935840">Farmageddon</a> by Philip Lymbery
and Isabel Oakeshott. It is the most important book I have read in a
number of years.  It is a dazzling journalistic expose of how
industrial-scale agriculture and factory farming has systematically
raped the world's farmlands in the last half century.
</p>

<p>
The book's main theses are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>pasture-reared livestock are a vastly more efficient use of global
food resources than factory-farmed animals: pasture-reared animals
consume mostly grass and their excrement fertilises the soil; by
contrast, factory-farmed animals eat food that could otherwise be
fed to humans (grain, soy and fish). Moreover, their waste is
difficult to dispose of and, when dumped on arable land en masse as
fertiliser, leaks into water systems and causes eutrophism and even
health problems in humans.
</li>
<li>overcrowded conditions for animals risk outbreaks of contagious
disease; to combat this, it is necessary to overuse antibiotics,
with predictable consequences. Even if the farmed animals are
treated, diseases and parasites can escape into and decimate wild
animal populations (the particular example chosen to illustrate this
was fish-farming of salmon).
</li>
<li>all of this is driven by overconsumption and waste of cheap meat and
fish products. One claim I found particularly staggering was that
the equivalent of 11.5 billion chickens each year are wasted
worldwide.
</li>
<li>monoculture and use of chemical weed control, while yielding bigger
and more consistent yields, are having a terrifying effect on
wildlife, to the extent where (coupled with the effect of climate
change) we may be experiencing a mass extinction event, primarily
caused by human activity.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The book concludes with some suggestions for how we, as consumers and
citizens can make a difference. One prominent suggestion which we can
implement very easily is to cut down our meat intake, avoid
factory-farmed products and buy local produce. If you're not
convinced, you should read the book.
