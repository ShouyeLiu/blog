These are the notes from a talk I gave to the UCL Undergraduate
Mathematics Colloquium in early October and I would like to thank them
for being such an attentive audience with so many good questions. The
talk is a gentle introduction to the work of Nabutovsky and
Weinberger, on how logical complexity gives rise to complexity for
sublevel sets of functionals in geometry.

The word geometry usually conjures up images of the Ancient Greeks
drawing triangles in the sand or doing unspeakable things with
circles. But this is flat geometry, Euclidean geometry, and really
we're interested in doing geometry on curved spaces. Of course, the
Ancient Greeks knew this because they knew that the surface of the
Earth is a sphere, and as the word "geometry" translates literally as
"Earth-measurement" we will start our discussion by contemplating the
geometry of the sphere.
</p>

<h4 id="sec-1-1-1">Geodesics</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
The fundamental question, for geometers and airline pilots alike, is
what is the shortest path between two points? The answer is a segment
of a great circle: a circle on the surface of the sphere which divides
it into two equal hemispheres. These curves are called geodesics (from
the Greek meaning "Earth-dividing"). As long ago as the first century,
the geometer Menelaus realised that you could use these geodesic
segments instead of straight lines to do geometry and invented the
subject of spherical geometry. This was radically different from
Euclidean geometry: for example, in spherical geometry, the sum of
angles in a triangle is always bigger than 180 degrees (Figure 1).
</p>

<p>
Of course, geodesics are not always length-minimising. If a pilot in
Heathrow wanted to get to Heathrow, she wouldn't fly all the way
around a geodesic till she landed back where she began. Similarly, if
she wanted to fly to Lisbon she would go around the geodesic segment
that passes over the English channel, not the one passing over the
Arctic circle. However, they are always locally length minimising:
each short segment minimises distance between its endpoints.
</p>

<p>
We use the same name, geodesic, for a locally length minimising path
in any curved space. A fundamental problem of geometry is to determine
the geodesics in a given space. For example, in general relativity,
the geodesics in spacetime are the trajectories of particles in
free-fall in a gravitational field. For example, the geometry of our
solar system is, to some approximation, the so-called Schwarzschild
geometry: analysing geodesics in Schwarzschild geometry tells you
about the trajectories of planets under the influence of the sun's
gravity and allows you to predict the perihelion shift of
Mercury. Indeed, when science documentaries tell you about what
happens when you fall into a black hole they are paraphrasing
statements about the behaviour of geodesics in Schwarzschild geometry.
</p>

<p>
Writing explicit equations for geodesics (as we can on the sphere) is
usually not possible and it is actually remarkable we can say anything
about them. But sometimes one can make nontrivial statements about the
qualitative behaviour without solving the geodesic equations
explicitly. For example, it is sometimes possible to guarantee the
existence of a closed geodesic loop, like a great circle on the
sphere. This is the question I want to focus on today: when is there a
closed geodesic loop in a given curved space?
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../img/length-functional.png" alt="length-functional.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>Figure 2:</b> <i>The length function on the space of all loops has a</i>
<i>global minimum at each constant loop and a turning point at each</i>
<i>geodesic.</i>
</p>

<p>
On the sphere we have actually seen two different types. There is the
great circle, and there is the constant loop (staying at the same
point). Obviously the constant loop minimises length, while the great
circle is geodesic but not length-minimising. You should think of this
by analogy with critical points of functions, where the derivative
vanishes: there are maxima or minima and there are turning
points. Indeed, there is a function on the space of loops which
assigns to each loop its length (Figure 2). The constant loop sits at
a minimum of this function. The great circle sits at a turning
point. Of course the space of all loops is infinite-dimensional and
finding turning points of functions on infinite-dimensional spaces is
harder than the usual problem in single-variable calculus. The
condition for being a turning point is that the loop solves the
Euler-Lagrange equation.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../img/grad-flow.png" alt="grad-flow.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>Figure 3:</b> <i>An elastic band moves along the gradient flow in the
space of loops, also known as the harmonic map flow.</i>
</p>

<p>
You can convince yourself that this picture makes sense by thinking
about elastic bands. An elastic band tries to minimise its tension,
which is proportional to its length, so it will always seek out a
geodesic. You can wrap an elastic band around a sphere, with
difficulty, and make it sit precisely on a great circle. But if you
perturb it slightly it will shrink and shrink until it pings off and
hits someone in the audience (it was a lively talk). If it were bound,
magnetically, to the surface of the sphere then it would just go on
shrinking down to a single point. In our picture of the length
function, we have pushed the elastic band off the turning point and it
has fallen down the graph of the length function until it hit the
constant loop at the bottom (Figure 2). It always travels down the
direction of steepest descent, that is it contracts as efficiently as
possible. This means that evolves according to a partial differential
equation called the harmonic map flow: just as the heat flow equation
describes how a temperature distribution evolves in time, the harmonic
map flow governs the contraction of loops to geodesics. These
equations are very similar in nature: they are so-called parabolic
equations, which tend to smooth out irregularities and converge
exponentially fast towards an eventual steady state.
</p>

<p>
One of the major themes of modern geometry and physics is the study of
critical points and gradient flows of functions on
infinite-dimensional spaces.

<h4 id="sec-1-1-2">Geodesics from topology</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
Now what happens if I use a more interesting space? The surface of a
doughnut, for example? This is called a torus and what makes it most
interesting is its nontrivial topology. It has a hole in it. We can
find loops which wrap around this hole, like the loop \(\alpha\) in
Figure 4. It is not possible to shrink \(\alpha\) to a single point whilst
staying on the surface of the torus. So suppose I concentrate on those
loops which can be obtained by deforming \(\alpha\) and I restrict the
length function to those loops. This new function has an interesting
minimum at the point \(\alpha\); in fact it has a circle's worth of minima
like \(\alpha'\) and \(\alpha''\) in Figure 4 obtained by rotating \(\alpha\)
around the torus. If I perturb an elastic band wrapped around \(\alpha\),
it contracts back to one of these minima via harmonic map flow.
</p>

<p>
We obtain interesting closed geodesics whenever there is a loop which
cannot be contracted to a point: just flow along the harmonic map flow
and you end up with a noncontractible geodesic. Of course you need
some hard analysis to prove that properly but, modulo that analysis,
we now have a theorem guaranteeing us the existence of closed
geodesics: if there is a noncontractible loop then there is a
noncontractible geodesic. Of course, there can be different kinds of
noncontractible loops in a space, so let us study noncontractible
loops more carefully.
</p>

<b>Figure 5:</b> <i>Multiplication in the group \(\pi_1(X)\) comes from

<h4 id="sec-1-1-3">The fundamental group</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-3">
<p>
Fix a point \(x\) in your space \(X\). Consider the set of all deformation
classes of loops starting and ending at \(x\). This set is called the
fundamental group \(\pi_1(X)\). It is called a group because you can
multiply loops: to multiply loops \(a\) and \(b\) starting and ending at
\(x\) you just concatenate them (Figure 5). The "inverse" of a loop
\(a^{-1}\) is just the loop \(a\) run in reverse.
</p>

<p>
For example, let \(X\) be the unit circle in the plane: loops in the
circle are determined up to deformation by the number of times they
wind around. Concatenating a loop with winding number \(a\) and one with
winding number \(b\) gives you a loop with winding number \(a+b\). A loop
with winding number zero can be contracted to a point. So the
fundamental group of the circle is the group of integers:
concatenation corresponds to addition.
</p>

<p>
For the torus it is more interesting: there are two circles to wind
around. Let us call one loop \(\alpha\) and one loop \(\beta\). We have
the interesting phenomenon that \(\alpha\beta=\beta\alpha\): best
illustrated with a picture (Figure 6). So the fundamental group is
\(\mathbf{Z}^2\): a loop is completely determined by two winding
numbers.

</p>

<p>
Our theorem now says: for every element of the fundamental group there
is a noncontractible geodesic loop representing that element. <i>CAVEAT:</i>
<i>Not quite! As harmonic map flow doesn't preserve the basepoint \(x\) we</i>
<i>are only guaranteed a geodesic in each conjugacy class.</i>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-4">
<p>
We started our discussion with geodesics on the sphere, which were
contractible. Indeed these were more subtle and interesting because
they were turning points and not minima for the length function. So
let me ask:
</p>

<p>
<i>When can we find (nonconstant) contractible geodesics?</i>
</p>

<div class="theorem">
<p>
If \(\pi_1(X)\) has undecidable word problem then there
are infinitely many contractible geodesics.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Some remarks are in order:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Having "undecidable word problem" means "being extremely
complicated" in a way I shall shortly make precise.
</li>
<li>This theorem is strange: it assumes there are lots of
noncontractible loops and outputs lots of contractible geodesics!
So what does undecidability mean?
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Undecidability</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Some problems are undecidable. That is we cannot write a computer
program to solve them. This is not just a lack of computing power or
ingenuity – we can't write a program to solve them because such a
program does not exist in the universe of all computer programs.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2-1">The halting problem</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1">
<p>
What is a computer program? It is a string of 0s and 1s which act as
instructions to a computer. Given an input string of 0s and 1s, the
program operates on the input and produces output. Two possibilities
arise: either the computer program terminates after finite time and
returns a string of 0s and 1s or the program goes on for ever and ever
and never stops churning. Anyone who has tried computer programming
will probably have experienced this and will have banged their heads
on the desk trying to work out what went wrong with their code.
</p>

<p>
It would be nice if we could write a computer program \(A\) which stops
this from happening. Maybe we tell \(A\) what program we are running
(\(P\)) and what we're going to input (\(I\)) and \(A\) tells us \(A(P,I)=0\)
or \(A(P,I)=1\). The output \(0\) means "don't try this or you will be
sitting there banging your head on the desk forever" (i.e. program \(P\)
will not terminate on input \(I\)); output \(1\) means "yes that's fine"
(i.e. program \(P\) will eventually terminate on input \(I\)). It may take
a long time, but at least if \(A(P,I)=1\) we can be assured that we will
see a result (or maybe our grandchildren's grandchildren will see a
result if the computer has to churn for that long).
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately we don't have such a program, because the halting
problem (as it is called) is undecidable. Program \(A\) could never be
written. Let's see why. Assume that some clever people have written
this amazing program \(A\). Of course their work is patented and closed
source, so we don't know how \(A\) works, all we know is what \(A\) does: eats
\(P\) and \(I\) and tells us if \(P\) will terminate given input \(I\).
</p>

<p>
We are naturally suspicious when we hear this, so we decide to write
out own program \(B\). \(B\) takes program \(P\) and asks \(A\) "If I fed
program \(P\) its own code as input, would it terminate?". If \(A\) says
yes (i.e. \(A(P,P)=1\)) then \(B\) goes into an infinite loop; if \(B\) says
no (i.e. \(A(P,P)=0\)) then \(B\) finishes and outputs 1. Schematically:
</p>

<pre class="example">
program B(P){
  if {A(P,P)==1} then
    label C; goto C; # this causes an infinite loop
  else
    return 1;
}
</pre>

<p>
Now we would like to demonstrate that program \(A\) violates the laws of
logic, so we run \(B(B)\). I invite you to contemplate what happens. If
your brain remains unfried by this contemplation, you will realise
that we must have made a false assumption, and the only assumption we
made was the existence of the program \(A\). So \(A\) cannot exist.
</p>

<p>
This seems like an abstract problem in logic, but there are
"real-world problems" in mathematics which are undecidable. For
example, for certain groups, the word problem is undecidable&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2-2">Word problem</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<p>
Remember that our fundamental group had a couple of loops which
generated it: any loop in the circle can be obtained by iterating the
basic loop which wraps around once; any loop on the torus can be
obtained by combining the two basic loops \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) in some
way. For example, \(\alpha\beta\alpha^{-1}\beta^{-1}\) is a loop on the
torus obtained by concatenating this "word" of loops (going once
around \(\alpha\), once around \(\beta\), once backwards around \(\alpha\)
and once backwards around \(\beta\)). Now we can simplify this word
using the relation we established: that
\(\alpha\beta=\beta\alpha\). Take all the $&alpha;$s to the left and the
$&beta;$s to the right and cancel \(\alpha\alpha^{-1}\) to the "empty
word" and \(\beta\beta^{-1}\) to the empty word so we get the empty word
overall. This corresponds to not going anywhere at all, i.e. the
constant loop.
</p>

<p>
<b>The word problem:</b> <i>Given a word in the basic loops, can it be
reduced to the empty word using the given relations?</i>
</p>

<p>
Geometrically, can the concatenated loop corresponding to the word be
contracted to a point?
</p>

<p>
Some groups G (see <a href="#Col">#Col</a> for an explicit example) are sufficiently
complicated that you can use multiplication in them to simulate the
behaviour of a computer (a "Turing machine"). Then you can translate
the halting problem into the word problem for G. So these groups have
undecidable word problem: there is no computer program which can
determine if the given word can be reduced to the empty word. I won't
show you how to build a Turing machine using a group: there is a nice
survey paper by John Stillwell <a href="#Sti">#Sti</a> where he discusses such
constructions. Instead I'll come back to our theorem:
</p>

<div class="theorem">
<p>
If \(\pi_1(X)\) has undecidable word problem then there are infinitely
many contractible geodesics.
</p>

</div>

<div class="proof">
<p>

</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If there are finitely many geodesics then there exists a list of
them. Maybe we're not good enough geometers to actually solve the
equations and write the geodesics explicitly, but we can assume
that somehow we obtained this list from an oracle who is good
enough. Remember, undecidability means that the program we're trying
to write cannot be written, not matter how ingenious we are or how
many resources we have. Let's assume we have this resource.
</li>
<li>Now given a word, form the corresponding loop.
</li>
<li>Flow this loop down the harmonic map flow until it becomes a
geodesic.
</li>
<li>Compare this geodesic with the geodesics on our list. This involves
finitely many steps as there are finitely many geodesics. If it
appears, we know the geodesic is contractible and hence the word
can be reduced to the empty word. If it does not appear then we
know the geodesic is not contractible and hence the word canot be
reduced to the empty word.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
So if there are finitely many contractible geodesics then we can write
a computer program to solve the word problem for \(\pi_1(X)\). This is a
contradiction so there must be infinitely many contractible
geodesics.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Bizarre! Having a really complicated fundamental group means that you
get infinitely many contractible geodesic loops.
</p>

<p>
Some more remarks are in order. First, step 3 of the proof is not so
easy to fill in because solving partial differential equations is
something nondiscrete: it uses the real numbers instead of integers
and computers can only cope with 0s and 1s. So we really need to
replace loops and harmonic map flow with some kind of approximations:
take a triangulation of our space and approximate the loop with edges
of triangles; flowing now means making moves on edges to reduce the
length of the loop. It turns out that this step is possible to achieve
(in theory) on a computer and this follows from work of Alexander
Nabutovsky <a href="#Nab">#Nab</a> (as part of a much deeper, more far-reaching paper).
</p>

<p>
Second, the fundamental group used loops passing through the basepoint
\(x\). Harmonic map flow (or its combinatorial replacement) might not
force loops to pass through \(x\), so really we should be working with
conjugacy classes of loops in \(\pi_1(X)\). This is OK because
undecidable word problem implies undecidable conjugacy problem:
deciding if an element is trivial is the same as deciding if it is
conjugate to the identity.
