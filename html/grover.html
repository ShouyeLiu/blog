I've been meaning to get my head around the idea of a quantum computer
for a while now and, since my mathematical energy is currently reduced
to clearing out my ETH office, I thought I'd do some reading and find
out more. I leafed through my dusty copy of Wikipedia <a href="#Wik">#Wik</a>, picked up
Kitaev et al <a href="#KSV">#KSV</a> from the library and turned to chapter two&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I think the easiest way to illustrate how a quantum computer differs
(functionally) from a classical computer is by explaining an algorithm
which only makes sense for quantum computers and which really
outperforms a classical algorithm for the same task (that is the point
of quantum computers, after all). The first algorithm they explain in
<a href="#KSV">#KSV</a> is called Grover's algorithm and it performs the task of
searching a database. Wikipedia <a href="#Wik">#Wik</a> has a really nice exposition
too, but I was initially confused by what they both call a "quantum
oracle" (sounds like something from Star Trek TNG). I tried to
explicitly avoid that in what I said below.
</p>

<p>
<b>TLDR:</b> Classically you have to look through all \(N\) elements of a
database until you find the right one (so runtime increases linearly
in \(N\)); Grover's algorithm has a surprising runtime of order
\(\sqrt{N}\) to do the same thing, using clever ideas from quantum
mechanics.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">The problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
You have a collection of \(N\) objects you want to store on a
database. The objects can be either black or white. Each object has an
identification number between 1 and \(N\) and a colour. For simplicity
assume that there's only one white object in the database and you want
to find out its identification number m. A classical computer would
work through the objects in the database one by one and check each one
to see if it were white. Assume that the probability that the kth
object is white is \(1/N\), then the expected runtime for this classical
algorithm would be
\[\sum_{k=1}^Nk/N=(N+1)/2\]
which is asymptotically linear in \(N\) (i.e. if you have lots and lots of
objects then quadrupling the number of objects quadruples the
runtime).
</p>

<p>
Grover <a href="#Gro">#Gro</a> showed that a quantum computer could do better, with a
runtime which goes asymptotically like \(\sqrt{N}\) (quadrupling the
number of objects only doubles the runtime).

<h3 id="sec-1-2">So what is a quantum computer?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Of course I don't know how to build a physical quantum computer. If I
did I'd probably have your bank account details by now. But let me
explain how to mathematically model quantum computers: how they
manipulate and store data. Classically, you store data as strings of
0s and 1s. On a quantum computer you store data as vectors. A "bit" of
a string (i.e. a place where a 0 or 1 could go) is now replaced by a
"qubit" – a two dimensional complex vector space with a basis
\(|0\rangle,|1\rangle\). Obviously you could represent 0s and 1s by
pointing in those directions, but you can now point in a whole host of
other directions, linear combinations of the vectors \(|0\rangle\) and
\(|1\rangle\). Note that the funny notation \(|v\rangle\) is standard in
quantum mechanics, was introduced by Dirac and makes it easy to talk
about vectors in the dual space \(\langle w|\) and the number you get by
evaluating \(\langle w|\) on \(|v\rangle\) is \(\langle w|v\rangle\).
</p>

<p>
A string of bits is replaced by the tensor product of qubits (i.e. of
vector spaces). In Dirac's notation we have a nifty trick for writing
tensor products:
\[|v_1v_2\rangle\equiv|v_1\rangle\otimes |v_2\rangle\] Let's write \(T\)
for the tensor product of all our qubits (this is now a
\(2n\)-dimensional complex vector space) and call it our state space. So
a string \(0011101\) can be transformed into a vector \(|0011101\rangle\),
but vectors can be added in all sorts of ways and we end up with
points in our state space which don't correspond to classical data
strings.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, \(T\) would be realised as the Hilbert space of some explicit
quantum mechanical system, but remember we're only interested in how
to model it mathematically (which is much easier).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Quantum algorithms and measurements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Instead of getting a Turing machine to work along a classical data
string manipulating the 0s and 1s according to some program, at each
timestep our quantum computer will apply a unitary transformation to
the state space \(T\).
</p>

<p>
After some sequence of unitary transformations have been applied
(which we think of as a "quantum algorithm"), we measure the
system. Now measurement is a tricky thing in quantum mechanics and I
want to avoid that discussion right now. But at least we have to
specify what we are measuring. Well suppose we just had one qubit and
we applied a load of unitary transformations to it (just unitary
2-by-2 matrices). If we started off with some vector, say \(|0\rangle\),
and ended up with another one, say \(|\xi\rangle\), we really want to
get back to basics and know if we've got a 0 or a 1. But that doesn't
make sense any more! It's quite possibly a superposition of the
two. "Measuring" the 0- or 1-ness of the qubit in a state \(|\xi\rangle\)
means:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>we consider the operator which projects the qubit onto the subspace
spanned by \(|1\rangle\),
</li>
<li>this has eigenvalues 0 and 1 with eigenspaces spanned by \(|0\rangle\)
  and \(|1\rangle\) respectively,
</li>
<li>when we measure the system we cause it to collapse into one or the
other eigenspace and the number we measure is 0 (with
probability \(|\langle\xi|0\rangle|^2\)) or 1 (with
probability \(|\langle\xi|1\rangle|^2\)),
</li>
<li>in order to ensure that all probabilities sum up to 1 (which they
surely should!) we need to normalise our states to have norm 1,
i.e. \(|\langle \xi|\xi\rangle|^2=1\).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
As I said, I don't want to justify this – we can treat it as axiomatic
or we can go and read Bohm. Either way, we end up getting a
probabilistic algorithm (i.e. we have to run the algorithm many times
and only afterwards can we guess what \(|\xi\rangle\) was by looking at
the probabilities).

<h4 id="sec-1-4-1">State space for the database</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-1">
<p>
First we encode our database into a vector space. Remember our data
consists of strings of length \(n\) (identification numbers for the
\(N=2n\) objects) and colours (black or white) for each object (yes I
know they're not colours, it's a figure of speech).
</p>

<p>
Introduce basis vectors \(|x_1x_2\cdots x_n\rangle\) for each
identification number and \(|B\rangle\), \(|W\rangle\) for the colours. Form
the tensor product \(T\) (state space) so that a general basis element is
something like
\[|100101001010\cdots 10010011B\rangle\]

<h4 id="sec-1-4-2">Unitary transformations for the algorithm</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-2">
<p>
Let \(U\) be the unitary operator \[U|xB\rangle\equiv|xB\rangle,\qquad
U|xW\rangle\equiv-|xW\rangle\] (writing \(x\) for an arbitrary
identification number) and let
\[|\xi\rangle\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_x|xC(x)\rangle\] where
\(C(x)\) denotes the colour of object \(x\) and the coefficient is for
normalisation (we want all states to have norm one). Finally we define
\[V\equiv 2|\xi\rangle\langle\xi|-1.\] The funny notation needs
another word of explanation: \(|\xi\rangle\langle\xi|\) means the
operator sending a vector \(|w\rangle\) to
\(|\xi\rangle\langle\xi|w\rangle\) (which is just a rescaling of
\(|\xi\rangle\) by the number \(\langle\xi|w\rangle\)).
</p>

<p>
These (\(U\) and \(V\)) are the unitary transformations we'll use in
Grover's algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Notice that they're both reflections: \(U\) reflects in the hyperplane
orthogonal to all white vectors and \(V\) acts as \(-1\) on the hyperplane
\(|\xi\rangle^{\perp}\) orthogonal to \(|\xi\rangle\) and preserves the
vector \(|\xi\rangle\).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-4-3">The algorithm</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-3">
<p>
We apply the composite transformation \(VU\) to \(T\) and specifically
look at what happens to the vector \(|\xi\rangle\) which we defined
above as \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_x|xC(x)\rangle\).
</p>

<p>
Diagram showing how the composite map \(VU\) is a rotation. What is the
operation \(VU\)? It's a composition of two reflections and hence it's a
rotation. To understand exactly what's rotating where, let's write
\(|\xi'\rangle\) for the projection of \(|\xi\rangle\) to the subspace
spanned by black vectors (normalising \(|\xi'\rangle\) to have norm 1)
and restrict attention to the 2-dimensional subspace spanned by
\(|\xi'\rangle\) and the vector \(|mW\rangle\), corresponding to the
unique white vector in our dataset (remember I told you a long time
ago that \(m\) is the identification number of the unique white object!).
</p>

<p>
Now \(|\xi\rangle\) is a linear combination of \(|\xi'\rangle\) and
\(|mW\rangle\) by construction, say
\[|\xi\rangle=\cos\phi|\xi'\rangle+\sin\phi|mW\rangle\] Moreover, we
know that the coefficient of \(|mW\rangle\) in \(|\xi\rangle\) is
\(1/\sqrt{N}\), so \[\sin(\phi)=1/\sqrt{N}.\] The two reflections \(U\)
and \(V\) preserve the 2-dimensional subspace spanned by \(|\xi'\rangle\)
and the vector \(|mW\rangle\). Indeed, reflecting using \(U\) gives
\[U|\xi\rangle=\cos\phi|\xi'\rangle-\sin\phi|mW\rangle\] and the using
\(V\) (exercise, very clear when you draw the picture!) gives
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../img/grover1.png" alt="grover1.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
\[VU|\xi\rangle=\cos(\phi+2\phi)|\xi'\rangle+\sin(\phi+2\phi)|mW\rangle\]
In other words, \(VU\) is a rotation by \(2\phi\) towards \(|mW\rangle\). If we
rotate \(R\) times then the \(|mW\rangle\)-component of \((VU)^R|\xi\rangle\) is
\[\sin((2R+1)\phi)\] and (remembering our discussion about
measurement) the square of this quantity \[\sin^2((2R+1)\phi)\] has an
interpretation as the probability that we get the right identification
number for the white object when we measure the identification number
in this state (i.e. after rotation). When \(N\) is large &phi; is very
small and we can pick \(R\) to make \(\sin^2((2R+1)\phi)\) very close
to 1. Indeed, when \(N\) is enormous, so that
\(\phi\approx\sin\phi=1/\sqrt{N}\) it's clear that we need
\(2R/\sqrt{N}\approx \pi\), i.e.  \[R\approx \pi\sqrt{N}/2\mbox{
iterations}.\]
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> we don't want to do any more than this, or else we start
rotating away from \(|mW\rangle\) !

<h3 id="sec-1-5">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
We only had to do Grover's algorithm about \(\pi\sqrt{N}/2\) times to
the right answer with high probability, which is a big saving – if we
quadruple the number of objects in the database then classically we
quadruple computing time, but with Grover's algorithm we only double
it!
</p>

<p>
Of course, we need to repeat the experiment many times to get a
probability distribution and pick the identification number which
seems to occur with a frequency \[\sin^2((2R+1)\phi)\] but we can do
this a fixed number of times (independently of \(N\)) because the
probability that we get the right answer is improving with \(N\). All in
all, we quadratically save computational effort and it's all thanks to
the tricksy use of (purely formal) quantum mechanics.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it's not clear to me how you would really implement this
algorithm (How would you start the quantum computer in the state
\(|\xi\rangle\)? How would you actually do the unitary transformations?)
so we should really treat it as a mathematical abstraction until
further notice. However, it's a simple and surprising illustration of
the power of quantum mechanics.
