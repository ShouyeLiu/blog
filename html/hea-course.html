Last week I had the pleasure of attending a course for new maths
lecturers run by the <a href="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/disciplines/maths-stats-or">Maths, Stats and Operations Research discipline
of the Higher Education Academy (HEA/MSOR)</a>. I was pleased that it
dispelled several myths for me, in particular the myth that these
courses never cater for mathematicians' needs. All the talks were
given by experienced mathematics lecturers or people who have spent a
considerable amount of time undertaking educational research specific
to university-level maths. With such good quality input, and with the
high level of engagement discussion amongst the participants, I
learned a lot. Here are a couple of ideas I took away (not necessarily
maths-specific!).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's important to let people figure things out by themselves. Maybe
this advice sounds obvious, but I realised during the course that my
natural inclination when I see someone struggling with a problem for
more than about a minute is to jump in and suggest or hint at the
next step. (e.g. "If you don't believe the statement, maybe you
should just try and write down a counterexample?") If someone
figures out the answer with my help, that's not as valuable to them
as figuring out for themselves how to even approach the question in
the first place. So in future I will try and sit back and listen and
let my students shine.
</li>
<li>Get students to construct examples. I liked this extremely practical
piece of advice. Instead of giving them a list of examples and
saying "Check which ones have certain properties," you can instead
ask them to get their hands dirty and construct examples. You can
even do this during a lecture to give them time to absorb the
definitions you've just told them (or to realise that they didn't
understand something). Much like a radio or an atomic bomb, when you
construct a mathematical object for yourself you understand it much
better than if it's handed to you with a set of how-to-use
instructions.
</li>
<li>There's a distinction between problems and exercises, and students
need both to thrive. Problems being problematic and involving
thought, exercises being repetitive (even if hard). The point was
also made that exercises can conceivably be automated and that there
is software (STACK, due to <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~csangwin/">Chris Sangwin</a>) which interacts with
Moodle (a popular "virtual learning environment") which allows
students to respond in mathematics which is then parsed by a
computer algebra system and the answer is checked. For example, the
student is asked "Give an example of an odd function", they input
\(sin(x)\) and the computer checks that they got it right. This has
the advantage that they can do many exercise and get immediate
feedback on how they're doing. By contrast, imagine having to mark a
student's answers to an indeterminate number of randomly generated
integrals&#x2026; isn't there something better you could be doing with
your time? You might argue that university level maths involves more
thought and proof than mindless computation, and maybe this
automation is more useful for pre-university students. That's
probably true, but my Methods course this term will involve plenty
of computation, mindless or otherwise.
</li>
<li>New lecturers are overambitious with content. Having lectured two
graduate-level courses and struggled to say what I wanted to say in
the time I had to say it, I can testify to this. But can I put this
observation to use when lecturing this year? My second years had
better hope so&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A useful piece of software I encountered was <a href="http://www.geogebra.org/cms/">GeoGebra</a> (for producing
geometric diagrams, etc.). While it's true that the same results (and
many more) could be obtained with Maple or Sage, it's also true that
GeoGebra is free and intuitive, and it's extremely quick to produce
diagrams of the sort it's good at (not as code-heavy as Maple). I'm
told there's a 3d version and this would have been useful for
producing <a href="./lines-through-four-lines.html">these diagrams</a>.
</p>

<p>
I can highly recommend this HEA course for new maths/stats lecturers.
