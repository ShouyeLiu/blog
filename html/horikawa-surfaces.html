<p>
Mostly for my own convenience, here is an overview of the geometry of
Horikawa surfaces (because I will forget most of this).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Horikawa's work</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
A <i>Horikawa surface</i> is a minimal surface of general type with
geometric genus \(p_g\geq 3\) which lies on the <i>Noether line</i>
\(c_1^2=2p_g-4\). These all have irregularity zero. This means that the
Chern numbers are given in terms of \(p_g\) by \[c_1^2=2p_g-4,\quad
c_2=10p_g+16\] These surfaces were studied extensively <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1971050">by
Horikawa</a>. Here is a summary of what he proved. Let \(n=p_g-1\).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The canonical map \(\Phi_K\colon X\to\mathbf{CP}^n\) has image a
surface \(W=\Phi_K(X)\) of degree \(n-1\) in \(\mathbf{CP}^n\) (Lemma
1.1). Write \(f\colon X\to W\) for the corestriction; then \(f\) is a
double branched cover. The ramification locus \(R\subset X\) of \(f\)
satisfies \(K_X=f^*K_W+R\); the branch locus \(B\subset W\) is the
pushforward \(f_*R\) and has no multiple component.
</li>
<li>The image \(W\) of \(f\) is one of the following
(Lemma 1.2):
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Type (&infin;)": (\(n=2\)) the whole of \(\mathbf{CP}^2\) or (\(n=5\))
the quadratic Veronese surface
\(\mathbf{CP}^2\subset\mathbf{CP}^5\).
</li>
<li>"Type (d)": (\(n\geq 3\)) a Hirzebruch surface \(\mathbf{F}_d\) where
\(d+3\leq n\) and \(n-d-3\) is even, embedded into \(\mathbf{CP}^n\) via
the linear system \(\left|\Delta_0+\frac{n-1+d}{2}\Gamma\right|\)
where \(\Gamma\) is a fibre of \(\mathbf{F}_d\to\mathbf{CP}^1\) and
\(\Delta_0\) is the unique section with square \(-d\). In fact, we
will see below that \(n\geq\max(d+3,2d-3)\).
</li>
<li>"Type (d')": (\(n\geq 3\)) the cone \(C_{n-1}\) on a rational curve of
degree \(d=n-1\) in \(\mathbf{CP}^{n-1}\subset\mathbf{CP}^n\). In
fact, this is only possible for \(n=3,4,5\).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will analyse the possible branch curves case-by-case below.
</p>
</li>
<li>If \(K^2\) is not divisible by 8 (\(p_g\neq 2\mod 4\)) then any two
Horikawa surfaces with this value of \(K^2\) can be connected through
deformations (i.e. there is a path in the Gieseker moduli space
connecting these surfaces: note that this path may connect different
irreducible components of the moduli space, but all surfaces along
the path are diffeomorphic).
</li>
<li>If \(k\geq 2\), \(K^2=8k\) (\(p_g=4k+2\)) then there are two deformation
classes of Horikawa surfaces with this value of \(K^2\) (Theorem
7.1). These comprise, on the one hand, surfaces of type (d) with \(d\)
even and \(d\leq 2k\), and, on the other, surfaces of type (2k+2).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If, moreover, \(k\) is even, then these surfaces are homotopy
equivalent.
</li>
<li>If, instead, \(k\) is odd, then they are distinguished by the second
Stiefel-Whitney class (type \((2k+2)\) is spin/has even intersection
form, the others are not spin/have odd intersection form).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally (Theorem 4.1), if \(K^2=8\), then there are two deformation
classes: surfaces of type (0) and (2) and surfaces of type (&infin;)
and (4'). Surfaces from different deformation classes are not
homotopy equivalent, distinguished by their second Stiefel-Whitney
class.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Type (&infin;)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
(\(n=2\)) The surface \(W\) is the whole of \(\mathbf{CP}^2\); the
ramification locus is then homologous to \(4f^*H\) (as \(K_X=f^*H\) and
\(K_W=-3H\)) so the branch locus \(B\) is a curve of degree 8 in
\(\mathbf{CP}^2\).
</p>

<p>
(\(n=5\)) The surface \(W\) is the quadratic Veronese surface
\(\mathbf{CP}^2\subset\mathbf{CP}^5\). We have \(K_X=\Phi_K^*H\), but
\(\Phi_K\) is the composition of \(f\) with the inclusion of the
(degree 2) Veronese surface, so if \(h\) is the hyperplane class on
\(\mathbf{CP}^2\) we get \(\Phi_K^*H=2f^*h\). We also have
\(f^*K_W=-3g^*h\), so \(R=5g^*h\) and the branch locus \(B\) is a curve of
degree 10.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Type (d)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
(\(n\geq 3\)) The surface \(W\) is a Hirzebruch surface \(\mathbf{F}_d\)
where \(n-d-3\) is a nonnegative even integer, embedded into
\(\mathbf{CP}^n\) via the linear system
\(\left|\Delta_0+\frac{n-1+d}{2}\Gamma\right|\) where \(\Gamma\) is a
fibre of \(\mathbf{F}_d\to\mathbf{CP}^1\) and \(\Delta_0\) is the unique
section with square \(-d\).
</p>

<p>
In this case, if \(i\colon W\to\mathbf{CP}^n\) is the inclusion, we have
\[K_X=\Phi_K^*H=(i\circ
f)^*H=f^*\left(\Delta_0+\frac{n-1+d}{2}\Gamma\right)\] and
\(K_W=-2\Delta_0-(d+2)\Gamma\), so
\(R=f^*\left(3\Delta_0+\frac{n+3d+3}{2}\Gamma\right)\). Therefore the
branch locus \(B\) is homologous to \(6\Delta_0+(n+3d+3)\Gamma\). Note
that since \(B\) has no multiple component, its intersection number with
\(\Delta_0\) must be at least \(-d\) (it equals \(-d\) if \(B=\Delta_0\) and
it increases for every other component of \(B\)). This means
\(\Delta_0\cdot B=n-3d+3\geq -d\) or \(d\leq \frac{1}{2}(n+3)\).
</p>

<p>
When \(d\leq (n+3)/3\) the generic curves in the class
\(B=6\Delta_0+(n+3+3d)\Gamma\) are smooth and irreducible. When
\((n+3)/2\geq d>(n+3)/3\), the generic curves in the class \(B\) are
reducible of the form \(\Delta_0+B_0\) where \(B_0\) is an irreducible
smooth curve which intersects \(\Delta_0\) transversely at \(n+3-2d\)
points. In particular, when \(n=2d-3\), \(\Delta_0\) and \(B_0\) are
disjoint.

<h3 id="sec-1-4">Type (d')</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
(\(n\geq 3\)) The surface \(W\) is the cone \(C_{n-1}\) on a rational curve
of degree \(d=n-1\) in \(\mathbf{CP}^{n-1}\subset\mathbf{CP}^n\). In this
case, \(f\) factors through the minimal resolution \(\mathbf{F}_{n-1}\to
C_{n-1}\) (Lemma 1.5). The branch locus in \(\mathbf{F}_{n-1}\) is
homologous to \(6\Delta_0+4n\Gamma\) and, again, \(\Delta_0\cdot B\geq
-(n-1)\). This means \(n\leq 5\) (in fact the only possibilities are
\(n=3,4,5\)).

<a id="FS" name="FS"></a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9505018">Fintushel and Stern</a>, in their classic paper on rational blowdown,
study a family of Horikawa surfaces they call \(H(N)\) with
\(K^2=2N-6\). This has \(p_g=N-1\), so \(n=N-2\). They take a surface of
type (0), which is then a branched cover of \(\mathbf{F}_0\) with branch
locus \(B=6\Delta_0+(N+1)\Gamma\). They point out that, smoothly, this
is the same as taking the branched cover of \(\mathbf{F}_{N-3}\)
branched over \(4(\Delta+\Gamma)+2\Delta_0\) (where
\(\Delta=\Delta_0+(N-3)\Gamma\) is the class of a positive section). At
least this makes sense when \(N\) is odd so that \(\mathbf{F}_{N-3}\) is
diffeomorphic to \(\mathbf{F}_0\).
</p>

<div class="remark">
<p>
Note that the choice of Hirebruch surface they give would correspond
to type (N-3) in Horikawa's terminology, which is actually forbidden
(the class \(4(\Delta+\Gamma)+2\Delta_0\) has no reduced holomorphic
representative in \(\mathbf{F}_{N-3}\) as its intersection with
\(\Delta_0\) is too negative). Nonetheless, this rational blow-down
construction does have a complex-geometric interpretation due to Lee
and Park. <a href="#LP">More on this below</a>.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Their motivation for choosing this Hirzebruch surface is that they can
find a rational homology ball \(B_{N-2,1}\) in \(\mathbf{F}_{N-3}\) whose
complement contains the branch curve. One can see this explicitly in
an almost toric picture for the Hirzebruch surface:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../img/fintushel-stern.svg" alt="fintushel-stern.svg" />  
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>Figure 1:</b> <i>An almost toric picture of the Hirzebruch surface
\(\mathbf{F}_{N-3}\): we have performed a nodal trade at the bottom</i>
<i>left corner so that a neighbourhood of the dashed line is a rational
homology ball \(B_{N-2,1}\) (the numbers \((N-2,1)\) can be read off from</i>
<i>how the dashed line intersects the sloping edge). Note that for this
picture to make sense, we need the length of \(\Gamma\) to be strictly</i>
<i>bigger than 1, otherwise the dashed line (with slope 1) will not
intersect the sloping edge at an internal point. The length of the</i>
<i>long bottom edge is \(N-2\).</i>
</p>

<p>
In the branched double cover we can therefore find two disjoint
rational homology balls (note that \(N-2\) is odd, and
\(\pi_1(B_{N-2,1})\) is cyclic of order \(N-2\), so the rational homology
ball lifts in two different ways to the double cover). Fintushel and
Stern prove that the result of rationally blowing down these two
rational homology balls in \(H(N)\) is an elliptic surface \(E(N)\).

<h3 id="sec-1-6"><a id="LP" name="LP"></a> Lee and Park on Horikawa surfaces</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
In an attempt to understand Fintushel and Stern's construction
algebro-geometrically, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3319">Lee and Park</a> showed that one can construct
Horikawa surfaces via \(\mathbf{Q}\)-Gorenstein smoothing. The idea is
that there is a singular surface \(X_N\) with two Wahl singularities of
type \(\frac{1}{(N-2)^2}(1,N-3)\) such that
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the minimal resolution of \(X_N\) is an elliptic surface,
</li>
<li>\(X_N\) is QG-smoothable to a Horikawa surface \(H(N)\) (in
the notation of Subsection <a href="#FS">1.5</a>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is how their construction works:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start with a Hirzebruch surface \(\mathbf{F}_N\). Let \(f\) be one of
the fibres, let \(\Delta_0\) be the section with square \(-N\) and let
\(\Delta\) be the homology class of a section with square \(N\).
</li>
<li>Find an irreducible curve \(D\subset\mathbf{F}_N\) in the linear
system \(4\Delta\) such that:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(D\) intersects \(f\) at two points \(p\) and \(q\); \(D\) has an \(A_1\)
singularity at \(p\) and an \(A_{2N-9}\)-singularity at \(q\). In other
words, in local coordinates \((x,y)\) at \(p\) (respectively \(q\))
where \(f=(x=0)\), \(D\) looks like \((y-x)(y+x)=0\) (respectively
\((y-x^{N-4})(y+x^{N-4})=0\)).
</li>
<li>Blow up \(\mathbf{F}_N\) at \(p\) and then repeatedly at \(q\) to
separate the branches of \(D\). The fibre \(f\) becomes a \(-2\)-curve
(it had square zero and is blown up twice). The exceptional curve
of the blow-up at \(q\) is a string of \((N-5)\) \((-2)\)-curves
followed by a \(-1\)-curve.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is a picture, with \(D\) and its proper transform drawn in blue,
\(-1\)-spheres drawn dotted, and in red, a configuration of curves
which, upon contraction, yields a Wahl singularity of type
\(\frac{1}{(N-2)^2}(1,N-3)\).
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../img/lee-park-horikawa.svg" alt="lee-park-horikawa.svg" />
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>Let \(Z_N\) be the blown-up Hirzebruch surface and let \(\tilde{D}\)
denote the proper transform of \(D\). Let \(E\) be the double cover of
\(Z_N\) branched over \(\tilde{D}\). The \(-1\)-spheres become
\(-2\)-spheres and there are now two disjoint red chains of
spheres. The double cover \(E\) is an elliptic surface: the preimages
of the generic fibres of the Hirzebruch surface are elliptic curves
(double-covering the rulings of the Hirzebruch surface branched at
the four points of intersection with \(D\)). The union of all
\(-2\)-spheres forms an affine \(A_{2N-6}\) fibre (a cycle of
\(-2\)-spheres).

<p>
Equivalently, we could
have taken the double cover of \(\mathbf{F}_N\) branched over \(D\) and
then \(E\) is its minimal resolution. We can compute the invariants
of \(E\): if \(L\) is a line bundle on \(\mathbf{F}_N\) whose square is
\(\mathcal{O}(D)\) then \(L^2=4N\) and \(K_{\mathbf{F}_N}\cdot L=-2N-4\),
so, using the formulae from Barth-Hulek-Peters-Van de Ven (Section
22, Eqs 9):
</p>
\begin{align}
K_E^2&=2K_{\mathbf{F}_N}^2+4K_{\mathbf{F}_N}\cdot L+2L\cdot L\\
     &=16-8N-16+8N\\
     &=0\\
c_2(E)&=2c_2(\mathbf{F}_N)+2K_{\mathbf{F}_N}\cdot L+4L\cdot L\\
      &=8-4N-8+16N\\
      &=12N\\
\chi(E)&=2\chi(\mathbf{F}_N)+\frac{1}{2}K_{\mathbf{F}_N}\cdot L+\frac{1}{2}L\cdot L\\
       &=2-N-2+2N\\
       &=N\\
p_g&=p_g(\mathbf{F}_N)+h^0(\mathbf{F}_N,K_{\mathbf{F}_N}\otimes L)\\
   &=0+h^0(\mathbf{F}_N,(N-2)f)\\
   &=N-1\\
q(E)&=p_q-\chi+1=0.
\end{align}
</li>
<li>Contracting the red chains of spheres we obtain a singular surface
\(X_N\) which Lee and Park prove admits a \(\mathbf{Q}\)-Gorenstein
smoothing. Indeed, if we contract the spheres in \(Z_N\), we get a
singular surface \(Y_N\) which is QG-smoothable; the smoothing of
\(X_N\) is obtained by taking a fibrewise branched double cover of
this QG-smoothing of \(Y_N\).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The most interesting part of this is that the singular surface
obtained by contracting only <i>one</i> of the two red chains does <i>not</i>
admit a \(\mathbf{Q}\)-Gorenstein smoothing. Indeed, Fintushel and Stern
already pointed out that the smooth 4-manifold (in their paper called
\(Y(N)\)) obtained by rationally blowing down one of the chains (which
would be a model for this smoothing) admits no complex structure
(Corollary 7.5):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it is minimal (by examining its Donaldson invariants),
</li>
<li>it has \(c_1^2=N-3\) and \(c_2=11N+3\), so it is neither an elliptic
surface (since \(c_1^2\) is positive) nor a surface of general type
(since the Chern numbers violate Noether's inequality), but its
geometric genus is \(N-1\) which is positive, so that exhausts the
possibilities for a minimal complex surface with these invariants
(by the Enriques-Kodaira classification).
</li>
</ul>

<div class="remark">
<p>
Note that the surface \(X_N\) is KSBA-stable (in other words,
\(K_{X_N}\) is ample). To see this, we appeal to the
Nakai-Moishezon/Kleiman criterion: suppose that there is an
irreducible curve \(C'\subset X_N\) such that \(K_{X_N}\cdot C'\leq 0\)
and let \(C\) be its proper transform in \(E\). We have \[K_{X_N}\cdot
  C'=K_E\cdot C-\sum a_jE_j\cdot C-\sum a_jE'_j\cdot C,\] where
\(E_1,\ldots,E_{N-3}\) and \(E'_1,\ldots,E'_{N-3}\) are the Wahl strings
and \(a_j\) are the discrepancies (if \(E_1^2=-N\), \(E_j^2=-2\) for
\(j\geq 2\) then \(a_1=-(N-2)/(N-1)\),
\(a_2=-(N-3)/(N-1)\),&#x2026; \(a_1=-1/(N-1)\)). We also have \(K_E\cdot C\geq
  0\) with equality if and only if \(C\) is contained in a fibre of the
elliptic fibration. All the terms in \(K_{X_N}\cdot C'\) are therefore
nonnegative. Moreover, they cannot all vanish: if \(K_E\cdot C=0\)
then \(C\) is contained in a fibre and so it either:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>intersects the sections \(E_1\) and \(E'_1\) positively, or
</li>
<li>coincides with one of the double covers of a \(-1\)-sphere, and
hence intersects \(E_2\) and \(E'_2\) or \(E_{N-3}\) and \(E'_{N-3}\)
positively.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In either case, there is a positive term in \(K_{X_N}\cdot C\).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-7">The famous open problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p>
The "most interesting case" from the points of view of low-dimensional
topology is the case \(K^2=16\ell\), \(p_g=8\ell+2\) (\(n=8\ell+1\)). In
this case we have two deformation classes of Horikawa surfaces, and we
know that the corresponding surfaces are homotopy equivalent. In fact,
all known smooth 4-manifold invariants fail to distinguish them, and
it is a tantalising open problem to determine whether or not they are
diffeomorphic.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One (type (0)) is given by the branched double cover of
\(\mathbf{F}_0=S^2\times S^2\) branched along a smooth, connected
curve in the homology class \(6\Delta_0+(n+3)\Gamma\). In
Fintushel-Stern notation from the previous subsection, this is
\(H(8\ell+3)\).
</li>
<li>The other (type (4&ell;+2)) is a branched cover of
\(\mathbf{F}_{4\ell+2}\) branched over a disconnected curve
\(\Delta_0\cup B_0\) where \(B_0=5(\Delta_0+(4\ell+2)\Gamma)=5\Delta\).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
One can also take the canonical symplectic form on these and ask if
they are <i>symplectomorphic</i>. The answer is not known; see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605692">Auroux's
paper</a> on Horikawa surfaces for more discussion about this symplectic
version of the question focusing on the smallest case \(\ell=1\),
\(K^2=16\).
