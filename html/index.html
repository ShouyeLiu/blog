In the spirit of <a href="https://floerhomology.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/erratum-to-appendix-to-algebraic-torsion-in-contact-manifolds-by-latschev-and-wendl/">Michael Hutchings</a> and <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~seidel/right.html#errata">Paul Seidel</a>, I have decided to use
this blog to keep track of clarifications and errata for my
papers. Most of my papers say something wrong or inaccurate but
nonfatal. In most cases, it doesn't seem worth filing a
correction. But occasionally someone asks me about one of these things
and, it being several years since I wrote the paper, I panic all over
again trying to figure out why their question doesn't invalidate my
work (piece of advice: when this happens to you, almost always trust
your past self; they were much more familiar with the paper when they
were writing it). I will keep the list below updated as I add more
clarifications and errata to the blog.

I have decided that next year I am going to try lecture-flipping my
topology module. Lecture-flipping is the practice whereby the lecturer
prepares material for the students to view/read ahead of time, and the
lecture is spent getting the students to explore the material in more
depth and consolidate their understanding. I have decided to document
my experience in case it's useful for other people thinking about
flipping (specifically in the context of maths lectures).

In this blog post I want to review:

<li>what it means in practice,

The archetypal physical system is the simple harmonic oscillator: a
ball on a spring following Hooke's law follows periodic motion along a
circle in phase space (its displacement and momentum oscillate
sinusoidally between two extremes and out of phase like sin and
cos). Understanding the corresponding quantum system is fundamental to
understanding quantum field theory: indeed, quantising a free
(bosonic) field turns out to be equivalent to quantising an infinite
collection of simple harmonic oscillators.

Equivalence relations are an important concept in mathematics, but
sometimes they are not given the emphasis they deserve in an
undergraduate course. Having a good grasp of equivalence relations is
very important in the course MATHM205 (Topology and Groups) which I'm
teaching this term, so I have written this blog post to remind you
what you need to know about them. I will kick off with a few examples,
then give a more formal definition.

underlying the standard model and grand unified theories and I thought
I would give it a bump:

<p>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1556">https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1556</a>

<p>
It overlaps with some of the material I touch on in the Lie Groups
course I teach (using representations to classify particles) but goes
into much more gorgeous detail and focuses on fundamental particles
rather than baryons/mesons. It is unusually easy to follow (if you
know a bit of representation theory) and I learned a lot from reading
it.

Constancy of the speed of light is one of those things that always

To generate the image maps I used a fantastic programme called

I keep finding myself trying to explain how the very simplest spectral
sequences arise (spectral sequence to compute the cohomology of a cone
or an iterated cone), so I have taken the time to TeX the explanation
into a <a href="../spectralseq.pdf">sequence of guided exercises</a>. This is all very formal and
diagram-chasy. One of the off-putting things about spectral sequences
is all the indices; in these exercises I have suppressed gradings and
concentrated on the very simplest cases to avoid overcomplicating the
notation. Once you’ve seen how the proof goes, you should go and look
in Bott-Tu or McCleary for some actual examples and computations.

Yesterday I gave a seminar about Fukaya categories and I didn't have
chance to do quite as much explicit computation as I'd hoped. I
thought I’d write a blog post with a basic calculation to show you the
kind of things that are involved in doing computations in Fukaya
categories. I will show (using Abouzaid's description of the zero
section in terms of the cotangent fibre) that the zero section and the
cotangent fibre have \(rank(HF) = 1\), in the special case of
\(T^*S^1\). This is such a trivial result in the end (you could do the
computation just by looking at the intersection and seeing it's a
single point) that you should think of this post as more of a sanity
check.

explicit cone eversion. In other words, find a path in the space of
functions on \(\{(r,\theta)\in\mathbf{R}^2\ :\ r\in[1,2]\}\) connecting
\(r\) to \(2-r\) such that none of the intermediate functions has a
critical point. One of these students, Tom Steeples, got hooked on the
problem, almost solved it, and afterwards used Mathematica to produce
some beautiful computer animations of a solution given by Tabachnikov
in American Mathematical Monthly (1995) Vol 102, Issue 1, pp
52–56. Here is one of his images. Reproduced with Tom's kind

In my <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3173">latest preprint</a> with Georgios Dimitroglou Rizell, we use the
topology of diffeomorphism groups of high-dimensional spheres to
produce interesting examples of nontrivial topology in
symplectomorphism groups of cotangent bundles. Until we started
thinking about this, I didn’t know much about the higher homotopy
groups of \(Diff(S^n)\) so here is some interesting stuff I learned
while we were writing this paper.

students" is now <a href="http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/video-report.pdf">available to download in PDF form</a>.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this e-learning project was to test the effectiveness
and viability of getting students to film mathematics lectures and the
effect on student learning of making these videos available. The
project was made possible by an E-Learning Development Grant (ELDG)
and by the cooperation of a large number of people who I thank at the
end.
</p>

<p>
Disclaimer. The project analysis is not scientific: there is no
attempt made at comparison with a control group, the data sets are not
large and the statistical methods used to analyse them are crude. This
report is intended to be at best a rough guide to the UCL Mathematics
Departmental Teaching Committee as to what action to take on filming
of mathematics lectures.

I have recently been thinking about Torelli groups.
</p>

<p>
The Torelli group of a surface is the subgroup of mapping classes
which act trivially on cohomology. Consider the case of an orientable
surface with \(g\) handles and one boundary component (diffeomorphisms
are required to fix the boundary). There is a famous homomorphism from
this group to the free abelian group of rank \({2g\choose 3}\) called
the Johnson homomorphism. The usual definition is pretty
algebraic-looking (involving the mapping class group action on the
fundamental group and its commutator subgroup). This week I read an
alternative (extremely beautiful, geometric) definition of this
homomorphism in Johnson's survey paper on the Torelli group
(D. Johnson, A survey of the Torelli group, Contemp. Math. (1983)
vol. 20, 165-179). This definition is probably very well-known, but I
didn't formerly know it and I thought it was too nice not to blog
about.

<p>
If anyone finds it useful, I've created a LaTeX command for drawing
the octahedral axiom (requires the TikZ package) based on this example
of Stefan Kottwitz. You can easily edit the code to add labels to
arrows (they would go in the empty brackets in the lines that say
"edge") or add these as extra arguments to the function.
</p>

<p>
Include the following code in the head of your LaTeX document:
</p>

<pre class="example">
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}

\newcommand{\Octa}[6]{\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm,thick]
  \node (1) {$X$};
  \node (4) [below right of=1] {$A$};
  \node (6) [below right of=4] {$C$};
  \node (2) [above right of=4] {$Y$};
  \node (5) [above right of=6] {$B$};
  \node (3) [above right of=5] {$Z$};
  \draw[-&gt;] (1) to[out=25,in=155] (3);
  \draw[-&gt;] (1) -- (2);
  \draw[-&gt;] (2) -- (3);
  \draw[-&gt;] (2) -- (4);
  \draw[-&gt;] (3) -- (5);
  \draw[-&gt;] (3) to[out=260,in=0] (6);
  \draw[-&gt;] (4) -- (6);
  \draw[dashed,-&gt;] (4) -- (1);
  \draw[-&gt;] (6) -- (5);
  \draw[dashed,-&gt;] (4) -- (1);
  \draw[dashed,-&gt;] (5) -- (4);
  \draw[dashed,-&gt;] (5) -- (2);
  \draw[dashed,-&gt;] (6) to[out=180,in=270] (1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}}
</pre>

<p>
Then the command
</p>

<pre class="example">
\Octa{X}{Y}{Z}{A}{B}{C}
</pre>

<p>
will produce a diagram like this:

h-principle learning seminar</a>. This will be a dry and technical
subject, so I thought I'd create some light-hearted preliminary

1-dimensional convex integration, used to construct an immersed loop
in the plane whose tangent vector has winding number zero.

"Why this equation?"
</p>

<p>
I recently overheard someone ask this about Schrödinger's
equation. The answer they received was, for me, unsatisfying. "Because
it agrees with experiment." Of course, that answers perfectly why the
equation was adopted by future generations of physicists and indeed
the calculation of the spectrum of atomic hydrogen from the energy
eigenvalues of the Schrödinger operator is one of the most convincing
and wholesome computations a young physicist can do. But the question
that was left unanswered, the question I believe was being asked, was:
"Why did Schrödinger write this equation down? Why not something
else?" I don't believe for a second that Schrödinger sat down with an
array of different equations and worked out what each of them
predicted about hydrogen before he found the one that fit&#x2026;

I've been meaning to get my head around the idea of a quantum computer
for a while now and, since my mathematical energy is currently reduced
to clearing out my ETH office, I thought I'd do some reading and find
out more. I leafed through my dusty copy of Wikipedia, picked up
Kitaev et al from the library and turned to chapter two&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I think the easiest way to illustrate how a quantum computer differs
(functionally) from a classical computer is by explaining an algorithm
which only makes sense for quantum computers and which really
outperforms a classical algorithm for the same task (that is the point
of quantum computers, after all). The first algorithm they explain in
Kitaev et al is called Grover's algorithm and it performs the task of
searching a database. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%E2%80%99s_algorithm">Wikipedia</a> has a really nice exposition too, but
I was initially confused by what they both call a "quantum oracle"
(sounds like something from Star Trek TNG). I tried to explicitly
avoid that in what I said below.
</p>

<p>
<b>TLDR:</b> Classically you have to look through all \(N\) elements of a
database until you find the right one (so runtime increases linearly
in N); Grover's algorithm has a surprising runtime of order \(\sqrt{N}\)
to do the same thing, using clever ideas from quantum mechanics.
