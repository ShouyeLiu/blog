I have recently been thinking about Torelli groups.
</p>

<p>
The Torelli group of a surface is the subgroup of mapping classes
which act trivially on cohomology. Consider the case of an orientable
surface with \(g\) handles and one boundary component (diffeomorphisms
are required to fix the boundary). There is a famous homomorphism from
this group to the free abelian group of rank \({2g\choose 3}\) called
the Johnson homomorphism. The usual definition is pretty
algebraic-looking (involving the mapping class group action on the
fundamental group and its commutator subgroup). This week I read an
alternative (extremely beautiful, geometric) definition of this
homomorphism in Johnson's survey paper on the Torelli group
(D. Johnson, A survey of the Torelli group, Contemp. Math. (1983)
vol. 20, 165-179). This definition is probably very well-known, but I
didn't formerly know it and I thought it was too nice not to blog
about.
</p>

<p>
Fix a point \(p\) on a genus \(g\) complex curve \(C\). Consider the
Abel-Jacobi map \(A\colon C\to\mathrm{Jac}(C)\) from \(C\) into its
Jacobian torus \(\mathrm{Jac}(C)\cong T^{2g}\) which sends \(q\) to
\(\mathcal{O}(q-p)\). Precompose this embedding with a Torelli
diffeomorphism fixing \(p\) (almost equivalent to fixing the boundary of
the complement of a neighbourhood of \(p\), except that
boundary-parallel twists are now trivial&#x2026;but the Johnson
homomorphism would vanish on these anyway). This gives another
embedding \(A'\); \(A\) and \(A'\) are now homotopic because based homotopy
classes of maps \(C=K(\pi,1)\to T^{2g}=K(Z^{2g},1)\) are determined by
the induced map on cohomology (which is the same because the
diffeomorphism is Torelli). This homotopy traces out a 3-cycle in
\(T^{2g}\), i.e. an element of \(\Lambda^3
H_1(C;Z)\cong\mathbf{Z}^{2g\choose 3}\). This is the Johnson
homomorphism.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you take the universal curve over the quotient of
Teichmueller space by Torelli (possible because automorphisms of a
Riemann surface act nontrivially on cohomology so the universal curve
exists as a bundle, not a stack). The corresponding universal Jacobian
bundle is trivial (because the Jacobian is cohomological and the
monodromies are Torelli). There is a universal Abel-Jacobi embedding
of the universal curve into the universal Jacobian and you project
that embedding into a single \(T^{2g}\) fibre using a trivialisation of
the universal Jacobian. Now homology classes in the quotient of
Teichmueller space by the Torelli group (equivalently the classifying
space of the Torelli group) pullback to classes in the universal curve
(taking preimages) and then pushforward to classes in \(T^{2g}\). The
induced map on \(H_1\) is the Johnson homomorphism (and there are higher
maps on higher group homology of the Torelli group). You need Torelli
diffeomorphisms fixing a point in order to talk about the relative
Abel-Jacobi map.
