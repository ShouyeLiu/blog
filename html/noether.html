Let \(\mathcal{F}\) denote the space of fields
\(\phi\colon\mathbf{R}^n\to\mathbf{R}\). The phase space for the classical theory of
scalar fields is the cotangent bundle \(T^*\mathcal{F}\). Since
\(\mathcal{F}\) is just a vector space whose elements are field
configurations \(\phi\), its cotangent fibre is also a vector space of
functions \(\pi\) (technically, this should probably be a space of
distributions, as it's the dual of \(\mathcal{F}\); we will ignore this
issue). If \(A\) is a vector on \(T^*\mathcal{F}\) then it has a
component \(A_\phi\) in the \(\mathcal{F}\)-directions and a component
\(A_\pi\) in the cotangent directions. We can think of \(A_\phi\) and
\(A_\pi\) as functions. The symplectic structure \(\Omega\) on
\(T^*\mathcal{F}\) is given by
\[\Omega(A,B)=\int d^nx(A_\phi(x)B_\pi(x)-A_\pi(x)B_\phi(x)).\]
Given a function \(H\colon T^*\mathcal{F}\to\mathbf{R}\), we can write down a
corresponding Hamiltonian vector field \(A\); if \(\delta H(B)\) denotes the
directional (functional) derivative of \(H\) in the \(B\)-direction then
\(A\) is defined by Hamilton's equations
\[\Omega(A,B)=-\delta H(B),\]
in other words
\[\delta H(B_\phi)=\int d^nx A_\pi B_\phi,\quad\delta H(B_\pi)=-\int
d^nx A_\phi B_\pi.\]
</p>

<div class="exm">
<p>
Consider the function \(P_i(\phi,\pi)=\int
  d^nx\pi(x)\partial_i\phi(x)\). We have \[\delta P_i(B)=\int
  d^nx(B_\pi(x)\partial_i\phi(x)+\pi(x)\partial_i(B_\phi(x))),\] so
the Hamiltonian vector field has components
\(A_\phi(x)=\partial_i\phi(x)\) and \(A_\pi(x)=\partial_i\pi(x)\). We
can integrate this Hamiltonian vector field to find a Hamiltonian
\(\mathbf{R}\)-action on \(T^*\mathcal{F}\). Indeed, consider the \(\mathbf{R}\)-action
on \(\mathcal{F}\) given by sending a function \(\phi\) to
\(\phi_t(x)=\phi(x+te_i)\) (where \(e_i\) is the \(i^{th}\) basis vector in
\(\mathbf{R}^n\)). To first order, this action is
\[\phi_t(x)=\phi(x)+t\partial_i\phi(x)+\mathcal{O}(t^2),\] so the
vector field generating this action is \(\partial_i\phi\). A group
action on \(\mathcal{F}\) induces a canonical group action on
\(T^*\mathcal{F}\) by symplectomorphisms and the corresponding vector
field on \(T^*\mathcal{F}\) is \((\partial_i\phi,\partial_i\pi)\), which
is precisely the Hamiltonian vector field \(A\) associated to
\(P_i\). In other words, \(P_i\) is the <i>momentum</i> associated to the
\(\mathbf{R}\)-action which changes functions (fields) by translating their
argument in the \(e_i\)-direction.
</p>

</div>

<div class="exm">
<p>
Consider the function \(H(\phi,\pi)=\frac{1}{2}\int
  d^nx(\pi^2+|\nabla\phi|^2+m^2\phi^2)\). We have
</p>
\begin{align*}
  \delta H(B)&=\int d^nx(\pi B_pi+\nabla\phi\cdot \nabla B_\phi+m^2\phi B_\phi)\\
  &=\int d^nx(\pi B_\pi+(m^2\phi-\nabla^2\phi)B_\phi),
\end{align*}
<p>
so the Hamiltonian vector field \(A=(A_\phi,A_\pi)\) is
\((\pi,\nabla^2\phi-m^2\phi)\). The flow of this vector field is
given by \((\phi(t,x),\pi(t,x))\) satisfying
\[\dot{\phi}=\pi,\qquad\ddot{\phi}=\dot{\pi}=\nabla^2\phi-m^2\phi,\]
in other words, by a solution of the Klein-Gordon equation
\[\ddot{\phi}-\nabla^2\phi=-m^2\phi.\]

Consider a free complex scalar field
\(\psi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\phi_1+i\phi_2)\). The Hamiltonian which
describes the time evolution of this system is \[H=\int
d^nx\left(|\pi|^2+\nabla\psi^*\cdot\nabla\psi+m^2|\psi|^2\right).\]
Writing this out in terms of \(\phi_1\) and \(\phi_2\) we get the
Hamiltonan for two free Klein-Gordon fields with mass \(m\):
\[H=\sum_{k=1}^2\frac{1}{2}\int
d^nx\left(\pi_k^2+|\nabla\phi_k|^2+m^2\phi_k^2\right).\]
Here, \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\) are the conjugate momenta to \(\phi_1\) and
\(\phi_2\). One slightly confusing aspect of this is that
\(\pi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\pi_1-i\pi_2)\).
</p>

<p>
Consider the circle action on the space of fields where
\(e^{i\alpha}\in U(1)\) acts on \(\psi\) to produce \(e^{i\alpha}\psi\);
equivalently, \(e^{i\alpha}\) acts on \((\phi_1,\phi_2)\) to produce
\((\phi_1\cos\alpha-\phi_2\sin\alpha,
\phi_1\sin\alpha+\phi_2\cos\alpha)\). This action induces an action by
symplectomorphisms on \(T^*\mathcal{F}\):
\[\left(\begin{array}{c}\phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \\ \pi_1 \\\pi_2\end{array}\right) \stackrel{e^{i\alpha}}{\to}
\left(\begin{array}{c}\phi_1\cos\alpha-\phi_2\sin\alpha
\\ \pi_1\sin\alpha+\pi_2\cos\alpha \\ \pi_1\cos\alpha-\pi_2\sin\alpha
\\ \pi_1\sin\alpha+\pi_2\cos\alpha\end{array}\right).\]
The infinitesimal action (i.e. the vector field on \(T^*\mathcal{F}\)
generating this action) is \[V=(-\phi_2,\phi_1,-\pi_2,\pi_1).\]
</p>

<div class="lemma">
<p>
This vector field \(V\) is the Hamiltonian vector field associated to
the Hamiltonian \[G=\int d^nx\left(\pi_1\phi_2-\pi_2\phi_1\right).\]
In terms of \(\psi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\phi_1+i\phi_2)\) and
\(\pi=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\pi_1-i\pi_2)\), this is \(G=-i\int
  d^nx\left(\pi\psi-\pi^*\psi^*\right)\), or, using the fact that
under the Hamiltonian flow of \(H\) we have \(\pi=\dot{\psi}^*\),
\(G=i\int d^nx\left(\dot{\psi}\psi^*-\dot{\psi}^*\psi\right)\). If you
are a physicist, this is the usual expression for the conserved
charge associated with the \(S^1\)-action (modulo a sign?).
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
We have
</p>
\begin{align*}
  \delta G(W)&=\int d^nx\left(-\pi_2W_{\phi_1}+\pi_1W_{\phi_2}
               +\phi_2W_{\pi_1}-\phi_1W_{\pi_2}\right)\\
             &=-\Omega(V,W),
\end{align*}
<p>
so \(V\) is the Hamiltonian vector field associated to \(G\).

<h3 id="sec-1-3">Noether currents</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Up till now, everything we have said is just like in the case of
finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems: when we have a symplectic
phase space, Hamiltonian functions give rise to Hamiltonian symmetries
of the phase space and vice versa. Now we come to a phenomenon which
only really makes sense in the field theory setting: the idea of
<i>Noether currents</i>.
</p>

<p>
We start with a Hamiltonian \(H=\int d^nx\mathcal{H}\) which generates
the time-evolution of our system. Suppose we have another function
\(G=\int d^nx\mathcal{G}\) which generates a Hamiltonian flow that
commutes with \(H\), in other words \(\{H,G\}=0\). An example would be the
free complex scalar field \(\psi\) with its free Hamiltonian and the
circle action rotating the phase of \(\psi\). The claim is that, not
only does the time derivative of \(G\) vanish along the flow of \(H\), but
the time derivative of \(\mathcal{G}\) is equal to the divergence of a
vector field \(J\) on space. This is a stronger assertion: if you
integrate \(\dot{\mathcal{G}}=\nabla\cdot J\) over space then you get
\(\dot{G}=0\) because the integral of a divergence is zero. Moreover,
you can figure out what the vector field \(J\) is using the
time-honoured trick of integrating by parts. The 4-vector
\((\mathcal{G},J)\) is then called the <i>Noether current</i> associated to
the symmetry. It is not uniquely determined, since we can always add a
gradient vector field to \(J\) without changing the property that
\(\nabla\cdot J=\dot{\mathcal{G}}\). Nonetheless, there's usually a
sensible-looking choice.
</p>

<p>
The key point which allows us to find these currents is the well-known
fact in symplectic geometry that if you have Hamiltonian functions \(A\)
and \(B\) (with Hamiltonian vector fields \(V\) and \(W\)), you let \(\phi_t\)
be the Hamiltonian flow associated to \(A\), and you consider the
function \(B(\phi_t(x))\) then \(\dot{B}=\{A,B\}=\Omega(V,W)\). Armed with
this fact, we will study the simplest example.
</p>

<div class="exm">
<p>
Let's revisit the example of the charged scalar field. Let
\(\alpha(x)\) be a function on space, and consider the modified
Hamiltonian \[G_\alpha=\int
  d^nx\alpha(x)\left(\pi_1\phi_2-\pi_2\phi_1\right).\] This no longer
commutes with the Hamiltonian \(H\). It generates the circle action
which sends the field \(\psi(x)\) to the field \(e^{i\alpha(x)}\psi(x)\)
(i.e. the phase shift depends on position). The corresponding
Hamiltonian vector field is
\[V_\alpha=(-\phi_2\alpha,\phi_1\alpha,-\pi_2\alpha,\pi_1\alpha).\]
Since \(G_\alpha\) and \(H\) do not commute, we can ask how \(G_\alpha\)
evolves along the flow of \(H\). From the previous paragraph we know
that \[\dot{G}_\alpha=\{H,G_\alpha\}=\Omega(X,V_\alpha),\]
where
\(X=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\nabla^2\phi_1-m^2\phi_1,\nabla^2\phi_2-m^2\phi_2)\)
is the Hamiltonian vector field associated to \(H\). In other words:
</p>
\begin{align*}
  \dot{G}_\alpha&=\int
    d^nx\left(\pi_1(-\pi_2\alpha)+\pi_2(\pi_1\alpha)\right.\\
     & \left.+(\nabla^2\phi_1-m^2\phi_1)\phi_2\alpha-(\nabla^2\phi_2-m^2\phi_2)\phi_1\alpha\right)\\
    &=\int d^nx\alpha\left(\phi_2\nabla^2\phi_1-\phi_1\nabla^2\phi_2\right)
\end{align*}
<p>
If there were no \(\alpha\) here then we could integrate by parts and
everything would cancel; indeed, that is why \(G\) is a conserved
quantity (when \(\alpha=1\)). Note that both sides are given by an
integral:
\[\int d^nx\alpha\dot{\mathcal{G}}=\int
  d^nx\alpha\left(\phi_2\nabla^2\phi_1-\phi_1\nabla^2\phi_2\right),\]
and \(\alpha\) is completely arbitrary. Therefore the integrands
themselves must agree:
\[\dot{\mathcal{G}}=\phi_2\nabla^2\phi_1-\phi_1\nabla^2\phi_2.\]
But the quantity on the right is equal to
\(\nabla\cdot J\) with
\(J=\phi_2\nabla\phi_1-\phi_1\nabla\phi_2\). Therefore we end up with
\[\dot{\mathcal{G}}=\nabla\cdot J,\]
as required. The 4-vector \(j=(\mathcal{G},J)\) is then
\[j^\mu=\phi_2\partial^{\mu}\phi_1-\phi_1\partial^{\mu}\phi_2,\]
which is what I meant by ``sensible-looking''. The equation
\(\dot{G}=\nabla\cdot J\) can be written in a more
Lorentz-invariant-looking way as
\[\partial_\mu j^\mu=0.\]
</p>

</div>

<p>
As an exercise, show that playing the same trick with the free real
scalar field \(\phi\) and the Hamiltonian \(H_\alpha=\frac{1}{2}\int
  d^nx\alpha(\pi^2+|\nabla\phi|^2+m^2\phi^2)\) yields
\(\pi(x)\nabla\phi(x)\) as the Noether current; this is the integrand of
the field momentum we studied first of all.
</p>

<p>
This trick only makes sense in field theory, where our Hamiltonian
functions have the form \(\int d^nx\mathcal{G}\): otherwise we cannot
insert a cheeky factor of \(\alpha\). It also relies heavily on the
equations of motion for \(G_\alpha\),
i.e. \(\dot{G}_\alpha=\{H,G_\alpha\}\).
