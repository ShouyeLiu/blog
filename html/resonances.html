How could you "detect" a new subatomic particle, given that it's so
small you can't see it and (often) so short-lived that you'd miss it
even if you didn't blink?
</p>

<p>
Let's suppose you have a process which you think might involve your
tiny, short-lived new friends. Maybe you suspect that if you smash
protons together, you might produce some particles&#x2026; which decay into
particles&#x2026; which decay into the particles you're looking
for&#x2026; which then themselves decay almost immediately into something
else, something that is more stable and easier to detect (something
like a pair of photons). How could you check that you were right?
</p>

<p>
First, you have to remember that in quantum field theory, thinking in
terms of particles is only an approximation of what happens on a
subatomic level. Instead, there is a collection of fields (electron
fields, photon fields,&#x2026;) and what we think of as "particles" are
localised excitations of those fields. Moreover, at any given time,
the field doesn't have to be in any definite configuration – it is a
messy quantum superposition of different configurations, in which
there are seven photons and a million photons and no photons, all at
the same time (amongst infinitely many other things). You can imagine
this as a C major chord played on the piano: you get a "note" which is
neither C nor E nor G, but rather a combination of all of these with
different amplitudes depending on how hard you pressed the different
keys; you shouldn't really think of it as a note at all, because it's
a chord – a superposition of different notes.
</p>

<p>
Second, you have to remember that in quantum field theory, the final
measurement you make only sees one of these constituent
configurations. When you make a measurement, you will detect a single
configuration, but each time you repeat the experiment and make the
measurement you could get a different answer. The amplitude of one of
the constituent configurations in the state of the field governs the
probability with which your measurement results in observing that
particular configuration.
</p>

<p>
So when you're smashing protons together, if you're interested in
processes that create photon pairs, the only thing you can measure as
an experimenter is the probability that a photon pair is
produced. There is a remarkable calculus for computing these
probabilities: the technique of Feynman diagrams.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start with two incoming protons and two outgoing photons.
</li>

<li>Imagine all the possible particle processes that could interpolate
between them: e.g. protons collide and produce an intermediate
particle which decays into two photons; or two protons collide and
produce an intermediate particle which decays into a bunch of
intermediate particles which collide amongst one another and
produce two photons; &#x2026; or any of an infinite number of possible,
ever-more-complicated processes! These intermediate particles are
called "virtual particles" because they're only really there for
computational convenience.
</li>

<li>Assign to each of these processes a number using the "Feynman
rules". Sum up the numbers. This gives the probability that two
protons can collide and eventually produce two photons.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
So, even though particles are slightly fictitious on this quantum
level, thinking in terms of virtual particle processes gives a very
good approximation of what is going on.
</p>

<p>
Now, you suspect that your favourite new particles contribute to this
whole story because they should be involved in one of the (infinitely
many) intermediate processes which is taken into account by the
Feynman calculus. So the big questions are: how would the existence of
a new particle affect the probabilities you can measure, and how could
you infer more information about the new particle (like its mass) from
these probabilities?
</p>

<p>
To understand this, we must look a little deeper at the Feynman rules.
</p>

<p>
When we compute the contribution of a particular process to the total
probability, we look at all of the virtual particles which are
involved in the process, and we include a factor like \(1/(E^2-m^2c^4)\)
(the precise factor depends on the virtual particles involved). This
factor is called the Feynman propagator; \(m\) is the mass of the
virtual particle, \(E\) is the energy of the virtual particle in its
rest frame and \(c\) is the speed of light. The strange thing is that
relativity tells us that \(E=mc^2\), so this propagator should be \(1/0\),
which is infinitely large. However, virtual particles do not need to
obey \(E=mc^2\). Particles which obey \(E=mc^2\) are said to be
"on-shell"; otherwise they are "off-shell". Importantly, the value of
\(E\) for a virtual particle depends on the energy at which the original
protons collided.
</p>

<p>
The outcome of this is that virtual processes involving particles
which violate \(E=mc^2\) by a large margin are not very likely (their
contribution to the probability calculation is suppressed by the large
denominator in the Feynman propagator). But it could be that for your
favorite virtual process, a particular choice of collision energies
results in your favourite virtual particle coming close to "on-shell";
suddenly the contribution of this process to the overall probability
of photon pair-production becomes large, and you see an "excess of
events" at that energy. This is called a resonance – the energy is
precisely calibrated to increase the likelihood that your virtual
particles are created.
</p>

<p>
This allows you to separate out different virtual processes from the
morass of things that can actually occur: you look at different
collision energies, repeat the collision many many times, and plot the
energy (horizontally) against the number of photon-pairs being
produced (vertically). At certain energies you will see a "bump" in
the probability, which indicates that there is a virtual process
happening with high probability, and that the mass of the virtual
particle involved is resonant with the energy at which the incoming
particles are colliding.
</p>

<p>

Higgs boson (detected by the CMS experiment in the Large Hadron Collider at
CERN. Image (C) Copyright CERN (2008-2014)).

<p>
Because you're interested in production of photon pairs, this would be
called a diphoton bump, or a resonance in the diphoton channel. Of
course, most particles are involved in many different channels
(e.g. dilepton), so you could look at something other than photon pair
production. If you find a resonance with a particular mass
contributing to many different channels then the likelihood is, you've
found a particle with that mass. Well done!
</p>

<p>
I have oversimplified everything rather drastically here: actual
computations with Feynman diagrams, the technical difficulty in making
particles collide together at high energies, the small probabilities
involved, the huge number of times the experiment must be performed,
and the statistical difficulty of looking for meaningful bumps from a
vast sea of data – all of these are things I have said nothing
about. But this idea of looking for and explaining resonances has been
behind many of the exciting particle discoveries that people have made
(like Z bosons and Higgs bosons).
</p>

<p>
[Disclaimer: I am not a particle physicist, and the above is just my
best understanding of what's going on. I have been teaching myself
some quantum field theory and, as a mathematician, it's easy to get
carried away with the gorgeous but complicated formalism. When I
realised that the small, on-shell, denominators in Feynman propagators
are responsible for detectable bumps, it was a nice way to connect
what I was learning back to reality, so I decided to write a blog post
about it.]
