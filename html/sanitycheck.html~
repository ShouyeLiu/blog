Yesterday I gave a seminar about Fukaya categories and I didn’t have
chance to do quite as much explicit computation as I’d hoped. I
thought I'd write a blog post with a basic calculation to show you the
kind of things that are involved in doing computations in Fukaya
categories. I will show (using Abouzaid's description of the zero
section in terms of the cotangent fibre) that the zero section and the
cotangent fibre have \(rank(HF) = 1\), in the special case of \(T^*S^1\). This
is such a trivial result in the end (you could do the computation just
by looking at the intersection and seeing it's a single point) that
you should think of this post as more of a sanity check.
</p>

<p>
The first 3 hours of what I said was essentially covering Auroux's
introduction to Fukaya categories (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7056">http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7056</a>), so
if you look at that first, you should be able to figure out what I'm
talking about. I hope that all my grading conventions agree with those
of Abouzaid – if you notice a discrepancy, please let me know!
</p>

<p>
Abouzaid (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4449">http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4449</a>) proves that a cotangent
fibre in \(T^*M\) generates the wrapped Fukaya category of \(T^*M\). In
fact, if \(L\) is an exact Lagrangian in \(T^*M\) he gives a prescription
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.5606">http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.5606</a>) for writing down a twisted complex
for \(L\) using only cotangent fibres. In the case when \(L\) is the graph
of an exact 1-form \(dF\) where \(F\) is a Morse function, there's a very
nice description: for each critical point \(p\) of \(F\) you write down
\(T_p^*M\) shifted in degree by minus the Morse index \(i_p\) of \(p\) and
the differential in the twisted complex between \(T_p^*M[-i_p]\) and
\(T_q^*M[-i_q]\) is an element of
\(CF^{1+i_q-i_p}(T_p^*M[-i_p],T^*_qM[-i_q])\). Abouzaid computed that
this Floer complex is quasiisomorphic to the cubical chains on the
space \(P(p,q)\) of paths between \(p\) and \(q\) with the grading reversed,
so the morphism should live in \(C_{i_p-i_q-1}(P(p,q))\). What cubical
chain do we take? We consider the moduli space of downward Morse
flowlines from \(p\) to \(q\), cubulate it, and consider that as a
\((i_p-i_q-1)\)-dimensional cubical chain on path space. The usual
combinatorics of the boundaries of Morse moduli spaces translates into
a relation satisfied by the different components of the differential:
namely the Maurer-Cartan equation. This means that the object we write
down is a twisted complex.
</p>

<p>
So here's our example.
</p>

<p>
Take \(T^*S^1\). The obvious Morse function \(F\) on \(S^1\) has 2 critical
points \(p,q\) and two flowlines. The corresponding twisted complex
should be
\[T_p[-1] \to T_q\]
where \(T_p\) and \(T_q\) are the cotangent fibres at \(p\) and \(q\). The
morphism should be an element of \(CF^0(T_p,T_q)\), which is
quasiisomorphic to 0-chains on the space of paths from \(p\) to
\(q\). Pick one of the two flowlines as a path connecting \(q\) to \(p\) and
postcompose with this path to identify the path space with the loop
space based at \(p\). The based loop space of \(S^1\) has \(\mathbb{Z}\)
components (indexed by winding number) each of which is contractible
so there's a model for chains on the based loop space which is the
group ring of \(\mathbb{Z}\), in other words Laurent polynomials
\(\mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}]\) (\(t\) is a formal variable of degree zero whose
exponent is the winding number).
</p>

<p>
The flowlines from \(p\) to \(q\) give two points in the based loop space;
by the way we identified paths with loops, we know that one of these
is contractible. The other one wraps once around the circle, so in
total the morphism should be \(1+t\). Therefore the twisted complex
representing \(S^1=\mathrm{graph}(dF)\) is \[T[-1] \stackrel{1+t}{\to}
T\] (I'm no longer distinguishing between different cotangent fibres:
they're all quasiisomorphic so I don't need to).
</p>

<p>
Now let's check that \(HF(S^1,T)\) has rank 1 (which it should because
the zero-section and the cotangent fibre intersect transversely
once!). \(HF\) means taking Homs from this twisted complex to \(T\):
\[HF(S^1,T) = \mathrm{Hom}(T[-1]\stackrel{1+t}{\to}T,T)\] Remember
this just means: take the direct sum \[\mathrm{Hom}(T[-1],T)\oplus
\mathrm{Hom}(T,T)\] with the differential \[a\oplus b \mapsto
(m_1(a)+(1+t)b) \oplus m_1(b)\] (this is precisely the
lower/upper-triangular thing you'd write down in the case of taking
cones of chain complexes). The differential \(m_1\) is zero for this
model of chains on the based loop space (I am basically saying that
the based loop space of \(S^1\) is homotopy equivalent to a bunch of
points, so it's formal and we can take its cohomology as the chain
model) so this differential is just \[a\oplus b \mapsto (1+t)b \oplus
0\] When is \(a\oplus b\) closed? When \((1+t)b=0\). But multiplication by
\((1+t)\) is injective on Laurent polynomials (we can invert \((1+t)\) in
the bigger ring of formal Laurent series), so this means \(b=0\).
</p>

<p>
When is a closed element \(a\oplus 0\) exact? When \(a=(1+t)b\) for some
\(b\). But a Laurent polynomial \[a_{-n}t^n + ... +a_mt^m\] is divisible
by \(1+t\) if and only if the alternating sum of the coefficients \(a_i\)
vanishes. This is one equation on the coefficients, hence the cokernel
of \(b\mapsto(1+t)b\) is rank 1.
</p>

<p>
Therefore \(HF(S^1,T)\) has rank 1.
</p>

<p>
While this seems like a lot of effort for a computation we can do just
by inspection (there's only one intersection point!) it's also
something you can imagine working for you much more generally if you
knew enough about chains on the based loop space.
</p>

<p>
Exercise: do the same computation for some other manifolds with
particularly simple Morse functions, e.g. \(S^n\).
</p>

<p>
N.B. If you're trying the exercise, note that Abouzaid proves the
cotangent fibre is quasiisomorphic to cubical chains on the based loop
space: this is important – composition of loops is basically
associative on the nose for cubical chains. For singular chains I
think you would need a nontrivial \(A_{\infty}\) structure (like
Stasheff found). Now there's a nice, tractable, model for cubical
chains on the based loop space, due to Adams and Hilton from the
1950s; if you're interested you can read about it (in the
simply-connected case) <a href="https://eudml.org/doc/139131">here</a>.
