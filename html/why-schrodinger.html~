"Why this equation?"
</p>

<p>
I recently overheard someone ask this about Schrödinger's
equation. The answer they received was, for me, unsatisfying. "Because
it agrees with experiment." Of course, that answers perfectly why the
equation was adopted by future generations of physicists and indeed
the calculation of the spectrum of atomic hydrogen from the energy
eigenvalues of the Schrödinger operator is one of the most convincing
and wholesome computations a young physicist can do. But the question
that was left unanswered, the question I believe was being asked, was:
"Why did Schrödinger write this equation down? Why not something
else?" I don't believe for a second that Schrödinger sat down with an
array of different equations and worked out what each of them
predicted about hydrogen before he found the one that fit&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I turned to one of Schrödinger's (eminently readable) original papers
on the subject:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.Schrödinger, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081217040121/http://home.tiscali.nl/physis/HistoricPaper/Schroedinger/Schroedinger1926c.pdf">An Undulatory Theory of the Mechanics of Atoms and
Molecules</a>, Physical Review (1926) Vol. 28, No. 6 pp. 1049-1070
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and was overjoyed to find that Schrödinger had a very definite picture
in mind when he derived his equation. The idea was this: some
ninety-nine years previously, William Rowan Hamilton had presented his
general theory of geometric optics to the Royal Irish Academy, a
mathematical description of light rays. This theory is a good
approximation to reality when the light a has very short wavelength
(like violet) but doesn't account for various optical phenomena like
diffraction, which require the finer description of light as an
electromagnetic wave. This description was put on a mathematical
footing by Maxwell who proved that electromagnetic fields propagate in
free space according to the wave equation.
</p>

<p>
Hamilton later applied his formalism to describe classical
mechanics. Schrödinger and de Broglie thought that one might
reasonably expect there to be a wave theory underlying classical
mechanics and reducing to it in the short wavelength limit. The
difficulty was how to guess a wave equation that would give the right
short wavelength limit.
</p>

<p>
Schrödinger took as his starting point the Hamilton-Jacobi equation,
so let's review this. I'll assume you're happy with the usual
Hamiltonian/Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
For any pair of points \(A,\ B\in\mathbf{R}^n\) consider the space of
paths \(\gamma\colon [0,T]\to\mathbf{R}^n\) between \(A\) and \(B\). Let \(L\)
be a Lagrangian and
\[I(\gamma)=\int_0^TL(t,\gamma(t),\dot{\gamma}(t))dt\] be the action
of that path. A classical path of time \(T\) joining \(A\) and \(B\) is a
solution to the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation. Let's suppose
we're in an ideal situation: for any \(T\) and any pair of points \(A\),
\(B\) there is a unique classical path \(\gamma_{A,B,T}\) of time \(T\)
joining \(A\) and \(B\).
</p>

<p>
Fix \(A\), but allow \(B\) and \(T\) to vary. Define the function
\[W(B,T)=I(\gamma_{A,B,T}).\]
</p>

<p>
The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is a PDE satisfied by this
function. Let's first compute the derivatives of \(W\) with respect to
\(B\). Replace \(B\) by \(B+b\) and suppose that
\(\gamma_{A,B+b,T}(t)=\gamma_{A,B,T}(t)+\eta(t)\). Then, for small \(b\),
writing \(\gamma_{A,B,T}(t)=(x_1(t),\ldots,x_n(t))\), we have
\[I(\gamma_{A,B+b,T})=I(\gamma_{A,B,T})+\int_0^T\left(\frac{\partial
L}{\partial x_i}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial
L}{\partial\dot{x}_i}\right)dt+\left[\frac{\partial L}{\partial
\dot{x}_i}\eta_i(t)\right]_0^T+\cdots\] by the usual Euler-Lagrange
argument for computing the first variation of \(I\). Since
\(\gamma_{A,B,T}\) is the classical path, the first term vanishes. Since
\(\eta_i(0)=0\) (the point \(A\) is fixed) the only remaining term is
\(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}(T)\eta_i(T)\). Since
\(b_i=\eta_i(T)\), this means that the first variation of \(W\) is
\[\frac{\partial W}{\partial B_i}=\frac{\partial
L}{\partial\dot{x}_i}(T)\] By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics">Hamilton's equations</a>, \(\frac{\partial
L}{\partial\dot{x}_i}=p_i\) so this says that \(\partial W/\partial B_i\)
is the ith component of momentum at the endpoint of the path.
</p>

<p>
Now, by the fundamental theorem of calculus:
\[\frac{dW}{dt}=L(T,B_i,\dot{B}_i)\] but by the chain rule
\[\frac{dW}{dT}=\frac{\partial W}{\partial T}+\sum_i\frac{\partial
W}{\partial B_i}\dot{B}_i\] This gives \[\frac{\partial W}{\partial
T}=L-\sum_ip_i\dot{B}_i\] where \(p_i\) is the momentum at the
endpoint. Since the Hamiltonian \(H\) and Lagrangian \(L\) are related by
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_transformation">Legendre transform</a>, we have
\[L(T,B_i,\dot{B}_i)-\sum_ip_i\dot{B}_i=-H(T,B_i,p_i)=-H\left(T,B_i,\frac{\partial
W}{\partial B_i}\right)\] so we see that \(W\) satisfies the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation \[\frac{\partial W}{\partial T}=-H(T,B,\nabla
W).\]

If we assume that the Hamiltonian is of the form
\[\frac{1}{2m}(p_1^2+p_2^2+p_3^2)+V(x,y,z)\] (in particular
time-independent) then we know by energy conservation that
\[\partial^2W/\partial t^2=\partial H/\partial t=0\] so
\[W(t,x,y,z)=-Et+S(x,y,z)\] for some constant \(E\), and the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation reduces to \[|\nabla
S|=\sqrt{2m(E-V(x,y,z))}.\] We also have the momentum \(p=\nabla S\)
from our earlier computation so the speed
\(\sqrt{\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2+\dot{z}^2}\) is \(|p|/m=|\nabla
S|/m=\sqrt{\frac{2(E-V(x,y,z))}{m}}\).

In going from geometric optics to wave optics you imagine little sine
waves travelling along your rays and you imagine that the phase of the
sine wave changes linearly with the optical path length. Via the
optical/mechanical analogy (the direct correspondence between the
Hamiltonian formalism of optics and of mechanics) one translates
optical path length into the action \(W\), so Schrödinger's guess was to
replace classical trajectories by sine waves whose phase is
proportional to the function \(W\). In other words, he postulates a
wavefunction
\[\psi(x,y,z,t)=A(x,y,z)\sin(W(x,y,z,t)/K)=A(x,y,z)\sin(-Et/K+S(x,y,z)/K)\]
for some constant \(K\). This constant has units of action so that the
argument of sine is dimensionless.
</p>

<p>
The frequency of this sine wave is \(E/2\pi K\) so, comparing with the
empirical relationship coming from the Einstein/Planck analyses of the
photoelectric effect/black body radiation formula, Schrödinger guessed
\[K=h/2\pi=\hbar.\]
</p>

<p>
I want to quickly recall the notion of phase velocity. This is
different to the velocity of our classical particles – rather it is
the speed of a crest of the underlying wave. The crest is a surface of
constant phase \(W=\pi/2\), that is at each instant \(t\) the crest is a
level surface of the function \(S\), that is \(S=\pi/2+Et\). Let \(u\) be
the vector field \(E\nabla S/|\nabla S|^2\) and let \((x(t),y(t),z(t))\)
be an integral curve of \(u\) starting at time 0 on the crest. Then
\[\frac{d}{dt}W(x(t),y(t),z(t),t)=-E+\nabla S\cdot u=0\] so the
integral curve keeps up with the crest. We think of \(u\) as the phase
velocity vector, so the phase speed is \[E/|\nabla
S|=\frac{E}{\sqrt{2m(E-V)}}\] Crucially, the phase speed depends on
\(E\) which depends on the frequency, so the wave equation which
underlies Schrödinger's matter waves must be dispersive (which means
exactly that the phase speed depends on the frequency – in other
words, different frequencies will disperse because they travel with
different speeds). Schrödinger next made the simplest guess as to what
the equation should be governing waves of a fixed frequency, namely he
guessed the usual wave equation
\[\Delta\psi=\frac{1}{u^2}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2}\] for
waves whose time dependence is through a factor \(e^{2\pi iEt/h}\). The
usual (light) wave equation replaces \(u\) by the constant \(c\). Here \(u\)
is given by the dispersion relation \[u=\frac{E}{\sqrt{2m(E-V)}}.\]
Since \(\psi\) has time dependence \(e^{2\pi iEt/h}\) this means that
\[\partial^2\psi/\partial t^2=-\frac{E^2}{\hbar^2}\psi\] Now
subsituting this and the dispersion relation into the wave equation
gives
\[\Delta\psi=\frac{2m(E-V)}{E^2}\frac{E^2}{\hbar^2}\psi\]
or the more familiar
\[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\Delta\psi+V\psi=E\psi\]
which is Schrödinger's equation.
</p>

<p>
For me, this route to Schrödinger's equation seems extremely natural
when compared to Dirac's magic with Poisson brackets.
