* Convex integration (cartoon)

[2013-02-10 Sun]

On Thursday I'll be giving a talk on convex integration at the [[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahcwe/h-principle.html][London
h-principle learning seminar]]. This will be a dry and technical
subject, so I thought I'd create some light-hearted preliminary
reading. Here then, in cartoon-form, is the simplest version of
1-dimensional convex integration, used to construct an immersed loop
in the plane whose tangent vector has winding number zero.

The technical details of the talk will be heavily based on [[http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~borrelli/Diablerets/1-diablerets.pdf][these notes
by Vincent Borrelli]], which is an excellent place to learn all this
stuff from.

*Warning:* The cartoon is big (about 1MB) and may take time to load.

** Further technical remarks

As you will see during the talk, a key aspect (not strictly necessary
in the example of the cartoon) is making the loop happen $N$ times
faster. Also, it's usually important for the basepoint of the loop to
vary. Imagine how you would use the ideas in the cartoon to construct
an immersed loop with winding number 1; you would use a family of
loops $\dot{f}_{\theta}(t)$, like the one in the cartoon, but rotated an
angle $\theta$ around the origin, then take the "diagonal loop"
$\dot{f}_t(t)$.
