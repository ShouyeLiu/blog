* Convex integration (talk notes)

[2013-02-15 Wed]

In case you were unable to take notes from my talk (either because you
were unable to attend or because you were present) I've written them
up below in some detail. They're basically just a summary of
Borrelli's notes.

Also relevant is the preliminary [[./convex-integration-cartoon.org][cartoon]] which contains many of the
essential ideas.
