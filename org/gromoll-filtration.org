#+TITLE: The Gromoll filtration

* The Gromoll filtration

[2014-07-14 Mon]

In my [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3173][latest preprint]] with Georgios Dimitroglou Rizell, we use the
topology of diffeomorphism groups of high-dimensional spheres to
produce interesting examples of nontrivial topology in
symplectomorphism groups of cotangent bundles. Until we started
thinking about this, I didn’t know much about the higher homotopy
groups of $Diff(S^n)$ so here is some interesting stuff I learned
while we were writing this paper.

The mapping class group $\pi_0(Diff(S^n))$ is a finite abelian group
and it comes with a natural filtration by subgroups called the Gromoll
filtration (thanks to Oscar Randall-Williams for telling us what it
was called – once something has a name it suddenly becomes easier to
find out what is known about it). Let me write this (in probably
non-standard notation) as:

\[\cdots \subset G_k(n)\subset G_{k-1}(n)\subset\cdots\subset
G_1(n)\subset G_0(n)=\pi_0(Diff(S^n))\]

The subgroup $G_k(n+k)$ is the image of $\pi_k(Diff(S^{n+k}))$ under a
natural homomorphism. The homomorphism is defined as follows. Think of
$S^{n+k}$ as $(S^n\times D^k)\cup_{S^n\times S^{k-1}} (D^n\times
S^{k-1})$. Represent an element of $\pi_k(Diff(S^n))$ as a map
$F\colon D^k\to Diff(S^n)$ ($F(y)=\phi_y\colon S^n\rightarrow S^n$)
for which $S^{k-1}=\partial D^k$ is sent to $1\in Diff(S^n)$. Now
consider the map $\Phi: S^{n+k}\to S^{n+k}$ which equals the identity
on $D^n\times S^{k-1}$ and equals $\Phi(x,y)=(\phi_y(x),y))$ on
$S^n\times D^k$. For suitably smooth $F$, $\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism
of $S^{n+k}$ and the map $[F]\mapsto [\Phi]$ is the homomorphism whose
image is the subgroup $G_k(n+k)$ in the Gromoll filtration.

We can think of this homomorphism $\pi_k(Diff(S^n))\rightarrow
\pi_0(Diff(S^{n+k}))$ as a “suspension” map. To understand visually
what this suspension looks like, here (see Figure 1) is a familiar
example in the case $k=1$, $n=1$. There is an obvious loop in
$Diff(S^1)$ (namely the loop of rotations: $F(y)$ is the rotation by
$2\pi y$ radians).

groups./

Suspending this loop by the above prescription gives us the Dehn twist
on $S^2$. Unfortunately the Dehn twist on $S^2$ is trivial in the
mapping class group, but this should give you a sense of how the
diffeomorphisms in $G_1(n)$ arise.

In fact, $G_1(n)$ is completely understood. Cerf’s pseudoisotopy
theorem implies that $G_1(n)=\pi_0(Diff(S^n))$: every mapping class of
an $n$-sphere arises by suspending a loop of diffeomorphisms of
$S^{n-1}$, that is “cutting along a $S^{n-1}$ and regluing with a
twist”. But to get a nontrivial mapping class, the twist is
necessarily more complicated than the loop of rotations.

Nontrivial elements in higher homotopy groups are sometimes fiddly to
get one's hands on; suspending an element
$\alpha\in\pi_k(Diff(S^{n}))$ and looking at its image in the mapping
class group of an $(n+k)$-sphere, then using that mapping class as a
gluing map to stick two discs together and make an exotic
$(n+k+1)$-sphere lets you turn $\alpha$ into a manifold
($S^{n+k+1}_{\alpha}$ in our notation), from which it is maybe easier
to extract an invariant to prove nontriviality. For example, if the
resulting exotic sphere does not bound a parallelisable manifold then
the original homotopy class must have been nontrivial. This (via an
incredible theorem of Abouzaid) is the way the Gromoll filtration
enters into our work: if a homotopy class survives in $G_k(n+k)$ modulo
the subgroup of $G_k(n+k)$ consisting of exotic spheres bounding
parallelisable manifolds then we can use the homotopy class to
construct nontrivial topology in the symplectomorphism group of
$T^*S^n$.

So it is important for us to know when $G_k(n+k)$ is
nontrivial. Fortunately, there are many interesting calculations of
the higher groups $G_k$ in the literature, providing a convenient way
to detect nontrivial higher homotopy in the diffeomorphism groups of
spheres.
