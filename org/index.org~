* Clarification for arXiv:1606.08656 			    :geometry:errata:

[2018-01-31 Wed]

[[http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08656][The paper Ivan Smith and I wrote on Lagrangian pinwheels in
$\mathbf{CP}^2$ and Markov numbers]] has recently appeared in /Geometry
and Topology/. Shortly thereafter, Yong-Geun Oh contacted us with some
excellent questions where our exposition was less than clear. In case
anyone else has the same questions, I thought I would write a blog
post clarifying these points.

* Clarifications and errata 					     :errata:

[2018-01-31 Wed]

In the spirit of [[https://floerhomology.wordpress.com/2012/02/28/erratum-to-appendix-to-algebraic-torsion-in-contact-manifolds-by-latschev-and-wendl/][Michael Hutchings]] and [[http://www-math.mit.edu/~seidel/right.html#errata][Paul Seidel]], I have decided to use
this blog to keep track of clarifications and errata for my
papers. Most of my papers say something wrong or inaccurate but
nonfatal. In most cases, it doesn't seem worth filing a
correction. But occasionally someone asks me about one of these things
and, it being several years since I wrote the paper, I panic all over
again trying to figure out why their question doesn't invalidate my
work (piece of advice: when this happens to you, almost always trust
your past self; they were much more familiar with the paper when they
were writing it). I will keep the list below updated as I add more
clarifications and errata to the blog.

* Flipping 					:teaching:topology:elearning:

[2018-01-31 Wed]

I have decided that next year I am going to try lecture-flipping my
topology module. Lecture-flipping is the practice whereby the lecturer
prepares material for the students to view/read ahead of time, and the
lecture is spent getting the students to explore the material in more
depth and consolidate their understanding. I have decided to document
my experience in case it's useful for other people thinking about
flipping (specifically in the context of maths lectures).

In this blog post I want to review:
- why on earth I'm planning to do this,
- what it means in practice,
- what I've already done.

* TikZ and org-mode 					:blog:org:emacs:tikz:

[2017-11-25 Sat]

As an org-mode newbie, it took me a while to figure out how to get
TikZ code in my source files to generate images in my blog.

[[./tikz.org][This blog post explains the solution I found.]]
 
* Noether's theorem in field theory 					:qft:

[2017-11-24 Fri]

This blog post attempts to explain Noether's theorem in field theory
(including Noether currents) in a way that might appeal to a
mathematician familiar with symplectic topology and the Hamiltonian
formalism.

[[./noether.org][Hopefully someone will find it useful...]]

* The Heisenberg picture and causality 					:qft:

[2017-10-25 Wed]

This blog post summarises what we learned about [[./heisenberg.org][propagators and
causality in free scalar QFT.]]

* What is a quantum field? 						:qft:

[2017-09-24 Sun]

As a mathematician trying to learn QFT, a question that always
bothered me was "what is a quantum field?". This blog post explains
one point of view (the Schr\ouml{}dinger picture) on the answer to
this question which I find satisfying.

[[./what-is-qft.org][Read on if you dare]].

* Pre-QFT 1: the quantum harmonic oscillator 				:qft:

[2017-09-15 Fri]

The archetypal physical system is the simple harmonic oscillator: a
ball on a spring following Hooke's law follows periodic motion along a
circle in phase space (its displacement and momentum oscillate
sinusoidally between two extremes and out of phase like sin and
cos). Understanding the corresponding quantum system is fundamental to
understanding quantum field theory: indeed, quantising a free
(bosonic) field turns out to be equivalent to quantising an infinite
collection of simple harmonic oscillators.

[[./shm.org][Read on for a description of this important quantum system.]]

* Quantum field theory reading group 					:qft:

[2017-09-24 Sun]

Like many people, I got into maths because I was interested in quantum
field theory and didn't understand what was going on. I have spent a
lot of time idly browsing QFT textbooks over the years in an effort to
rectify this, but stuff always got in the way.

[[https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucaheps][Ed Segal]] and I are planning to run a QFT reading group at UCL to
improve our understanding. I will post my own notes from the reading
group to this blog, as well as some foundational "pre-QFT" material
which I always forget and have to re-read whenever I start looking
into this stuff after a long break.

If you are interested in attending the reading group, please let Ed or
me know.

* Equivalence relations 				  :revision:mathm205:

[2017-09-17 Sun]

Equivalence relations are an important concept in mathematics, but
sometimes they are not given the emphasis they deserve in an
undergraduate course. Having a good grasp of equivalence relations is
very important in the course MATHM205 (Topology and Groups) which I'm
teaching this term, so I have written this blog post to remind you
what you need to know about them. I will kick off with a few examples,
then give a more formal definition.

* Theorem and proof environments in CSS 			   :blog:org:

[2017-09-12 Tue]

Here is a nice idea from [[http://drz.ac/2013/01/17/latex-theorem-like-environments-for-the-web/][Dr Z.ac]], the blog of Zachary Harmany. You can
use CSS to create LaTeX-style theorem/proof environments on a website.

* Connecting to wifi from command line 				 :linux:wifi:

[2017-09-12 Tue]

I so rarely need to connect to a new wifi network that, when I do, I
always forget how I managed to do it the previous time. For future
reference, here's how I did it this time (using "NetworkManager
Command Line Interface" or "nmcli"):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ nmcli dev wifi list
$ nmcli dev wifi connect NETWORKNAME password NETWORKPASSWORD
#+END_EXAMPLE

* New blog 						     :blog:org:emacs:

[2017-09-12 Tue]

I've decided that I don't like my old blog and I'm setting up a
new blog using org-mode.

* Resonances 								:qft:

[2016-10-30 Sun]

How could you "detect" a new subatomic particle, given that it's so
small you can't see it and (often) so short-lived that you'd miss it
even if you didn't blink?

[[./resonances.org][Read on to find out how...]]

* Nice paper bump 							:qft:

[2016-08-31 Wed]

It's 7 years old, but I only just came across the following beautiful
expository paper of Baez and Huerta on the representation theory
underlying the standard model and grand unified theories and I thought
I would give it a bump:

[[https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1556]]

It overlaps with some of the material I touch on in the Lie Groups
course I teach (using representations to classify particles) but goes
into much more gorgeous detail and focuses on fundamental particles
rather than baryons/mesons. It is unusually easy to follow (if you
know a bit of representation theory) and I learned a lot from reading
it.

* Is the speed of light constant? 			   :relativity:light:

[2016-08-09 Tue]

I recently came across
[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_proof_of_the_constancy_of_the_velocity_of_light][
a beautiful argument due to De Sitter (1913)]], which gave the
(first?) experimental evidence that light moves with a constant speed.

Constancy of the speed of light is one of those things that always
bothered me, and I spent a couple of days recently trying to unbother
myself. De Sitter's argument is what finally satisfied me. Below, I’m
going to explain the background, then I'll explain De Sitter's
argument. The De Sitter paper is only a couple of paragraphs long and
is available via Wikisource, so if you don't need the introductory
remarks in the blogpost below, just follow the link above and read it.

* Using graphviz to illustrate course structure     :code:elearning:teaching:

[2015-10-22 Thu]

At some point last year, I got frustrated that I couldn’t see easily
the global structure of the UCL undergraduate maths course without
trawling through a bunch of PDFs, so I made [[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/pathways.htm][this webpage]] to illustrate
it. Hopefully some people have found this useful in deciding which
modules to choose or in advising students which modules to take.

To generate the image maps I used a fantastic programme called
graphviz. In case anyone wants to adapt what I did to their own ends,
I have made my graphviz code for these diagrams (plus some ancillary
shells scripts for creating and uploading the webpage) available [[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/choices/pathways.zip][here:]]

For more details, see the [[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/choices/readme.txt][readme file]].

* Some simple spectral sequences 		  :algebra:geometry:teaching:

[2015-04-28 Tue]

I keep finding myself trying to explain how the very simplest spectral
sequences arise (spectral sequence to compute the cohomology of a cone
or an iterated cone), so I have taken the time to TeX the explanation
into a [[../spectralseq.pdf][sequence of guided exercises]]. This is all very formal and
diagram-chasy. One of the off-putting things about spectral sequences
is all the indices; in these exercises I have suppressed gradings and
concentrated on the very simplest cases to avoid overcomplicating the
notation. Once you’ve seen how the proof goes, you should go and look
in Bott-Tu or McCleary for some actual examples and computations.

Please let me know of any errors in the exercises!
* A sanity check for the Fukaya category of a cotangent bundle :algebra:geometry:

[2015-02-15 Tue]

Yesterday I gave a seminar about Fukaya categories and I didn't have
chance to do quite as much explicit computation as I'd hoped. I
thought I’d write a blog post with a basic calculation to show you the
kind of things that are involved in doing computations in Fukaya
categories. I will show (using Abouzaid's description of the zero
section in terms of the cotangent fibre) that the zero section and the
cotangent fibre have $rank(HF) = 1$, in the special case of
$T^*S^1$. This is such a trivial result in the end (you could do the
computation just by looking at the intersection and seeing it's a
single point) that you should think of this post as more of a sanity
check.

[[./sanitycheck.org][Read on to test your sanity.]]
* Cone eversion 					  :topology:geometry:

[2014-10-12 Sun]

Last year, around the time Chris Wendl was running the h-principle
learning seminar at UCL, I set my second years an exercise from
Eliashberg-Mishachev as a difficult challenge problem: to find an
explicit cone eversion. In other words, find a path in the space of
functions on $\{(r,\theta)\in\mathbf{R}^2\ :\ r\in[1,2]\}$ connecting
$r$ to $2-r$ such that none of the intermediate functions has a
critical point. One of these students, Tom Steeples, got hooked on the
problem, almost solved it, and afterwards used Mathematica to produce
some beautiful computer animations of a solution given by Tabachnikov
in American Mathematical Monthly (1995) Vol 102, Issue 1, pp
52–56. Here is one of his images. Reproduced with Tom's kind
permission (the copyright is his).

* Gromoll filtration 					  :topology:geometry:

[2014-07-14 Mon]

In my [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3173][latest preprint]] with Georgios Dimitroglou Rizell, we use the
topology of diffeomorphism groups of high-dimensional spheres to
produce interesting examples of nontrivial topology in
symplectomorphism groups of cotangent bundles. Until we started
thinking about this, I didn’t know much about the higher homotopy
groups of $Diff(S^n)$ so here is some interesting stuff I learned
while we were writing this paper.

* E-learning project report 					  :elearning:teaching: 

[2014-06-12 Thu]

My final report on the e-learning project "Video lectures filmed by
students" is now [[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/video-report.pdf][available to download in PDF form]].

The purpose of this e-learning project was to test the effectiveness
and viability of getting students to film mathematics lectures and the
effect on student learning of making these videos available. The
project was made possible by an E-Learning Development Grant (ELDG)
and by the cooperation of a large number of people who I thank at the
end.

Disclaimer. The project analysis is not scientific: there is no
attempt made at comparison with a control group, the data sets are not
large and the statistical methods used to analyse them are crude. This
report is intended to be at best a rough guide to the UCL Mathematics
Departmental Teaching Committee as to what action to take on filming
of mathematics lectures.

* December: video project update 				  :elearning:teaching:

[2014-12-14 Sun]

The video project has been progressing nicely: all of the videos have
now been compressed and most have been uploaded to either Youtube or
Lecturecast.

* Geometry and undecidability 					   :geometry:

[2013-11-21 Thu]

These are the notes from a talk I gave to the UCL Undergraduate
Mathematics Colloquium in early October and I would like to thank them
for being such an attentive audience with so many good questions. The
talk is a gentle introduction to the work of Nabutovsky and
Weinberger, on how logical complexity gives rise to complexity for
sublevel sets of functionals in geometry.

* Video-lecture project weeks 1 and 2 			 :elearning:teaching:

[2013-10-10 Thu]

The e-learning project for filming maths lectures is now underway
(into its second week). You can see some of the initial results [[http://youtu.be/JQv4QlYOtNM][here]]

* E-Learning: Spring 2013 				 :elearning:teaching:

[2013-06-27 Wed]

Henry Wilton, Bonita Carboo and I are the UCL Maths Department's
e-learning reps. In the interests of sharing ideas, here are a few
things I have discovered this Spring about e-learning which may be
useful to others.

* Bored now 							   :teaching:

[2013-05-01 Wed]

I just read a BBC article about Jimmy Wales called "Boring university
lectures are doomed" and the title and the tone of the article made me
angry. As a boring university lecturer, I felt I should speak out.

* The geometric definition of the Johnson homomorphism 	  :topology:geometry:

[2013-04-26 Fri]

I have recently been thinking about Torelli groups.

The Torelli group of a surface is the subgroup of mapping classes
which act trivially on cohomology. Consider the case of an orientable
surface with $g$ handles and one boundary component (diffeomorphisms
are required to fix the boundary). There is a famous homomorphism from
this group to the free abelian group of rank ${2g\choose 3}$ called
the Johnson homomorphism. The usual definition is pretty
algebraic-looking (involving the mapping class group action on the
fundamental group and its commutator subgroup). This week I read an
alternative (extremely beautiful, geometric) definition of this
homomorphism in Johnson's survey paper on the Torelli group
(D. Johnson, A survey of the Torelli group, Contemp. Math. (1983)
vol. 20, 165-179). This definition is probably very well-known, but I
didn't formerly know it and I thought it was too nice not to blog
about.

* TikZ code for the octahedral axiom 			       :algebra:tikz:

[2013-03-01 Fri]

If anyone finds it useful, I've created a LaTeX command for drawing
the octahedral axiom (requires the TikZ package) based on this example
of Stefan Kottwitz. You can easily edit the code to add labels to
arrows (they would go in the empty brackets in the lines that say
"edge") or add these as extra arguments to the function.

Include the following code in the head of your LaTeX document:

#+BEGIN_example
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}

\newcommand{\Octa}[6]{\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm,thick]
  \node (1) {$X$};
  \node (4) [below right of=1] {$A$};
  \node (6) [below right of=4] {$C$};
  \node (2) [above right of=4] {$Y$};
  \node (5) [above right of=6] {$B$};
  \node (3) [above right of=5] {$Z$};
  \draw[->] (1) to[out=25,in=155] (3);
  \draw[->] (1) -- (2);
  \draw[->] (2) -- (3);
  \draw[->] (2) -- (4);
  \draw[->] (3) -- (5);
  \draw[->] (3) to[out=260,in=0] (6);
  \draw[->] (4) -- (6);
  \draw[dashed,->] (4) -- (1);
  \draw[->] (6) -- (5);
  \draw[dashed,->] (4) -- (1);
  \draw[dashed,->] (5) -- (4);
  \draw[dashed,->] (5) -- (2);
  \draw[dashed,->] (6) to[out=180,in=270] (1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}}
#+END_example

Then the command

#+BEGIN_example
\Octa{X}{Y}{Z}{A}{B}{C}
#+END_example

will produce a diagram like this:

#+HEADER: :file ../img/octa.svg :imagemagick yes
#+HEADER: :results output silent  :headers '("\\usepackage{tikz}")
#+HEADER: :fit yes :imoutoptions -geometry 400 :iminoptions -density 600
#+BEGIN_src latex
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm,thick]
  \node (1) {$X$};
  \node (4) [below right of=1] {$A$};
  \node (6) [below right of=4] {$C$};
  \node (2) [above right of=4] {$Y$};
  \node (5) [above right of=6] {$B$};
  \node (3) [above right of=5] {$Z$};
  \draw[->] (1) to[out=25,in=155] (3);
  \draw[->] (1) -- (2);
  \draw[->] (2) -- (3);
  \draw[->] (2) -- (4);

  \draw[dashed,->] (4) -- (1);
  \draw[dashed,->] (5) -- (4);
  \draw[dashed,->] (5) -- (2);
  \draw[dashed,->] (6) to[out=180,in=270] (1);
\end{tikzpicture}
#+END_src

* Convex Integration (talk notes) 				   :topology:

[2013-02-15 Wed]

In case you were unable to take notes from my talk (either because you
were unable to attend or because you were present) I've written them
up below in some detail. They're basically just a summary of
Borrelli's notes.

Also relevant is the preliminary [[./convex-integration-cartoon.org][cartoon]] which contains many of the
essential ideas.

* Convex integration (cartoon) 					   :topology:

[2013-02-10 Sun]

On Thursday I'll be giving a talk on convex integration at the [[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahcwe/h-principle.html][London
h-principle learning seminar]]. This will be a dry and technical
subject, so I thought I'd create some light-hearted preliminary
reading. Here then, in cartoon-form, is the simplest version of
1-dimensional convex integration, used to construct an immersed loop
in the plane whose tangent vector has winding number zero.

The technical details of the talk will be heavily based on [[http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~borrelli/Diablerets/1-diablerets.pdf][these notes
by Vincent Borrelli]], which is an excellent place to learn all this
stuff from.

* Kronheimer's argument: Small resolutions and Dehn twists :geometry:topology:
  
[2013-01-27 Sun]

I want to amplify an expository argument I gave in [[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/tokyo1.pdf][a recent lecture]]
which shows that the squared Dehn twist on a symplectic 4-manifold is
smoothly isotopic to the identity map. This is an old argument of
Kronheimer and I only managed to sketch it hurriedly in the lecture. A
few people have asked me to explain this to them in the past, so...

* Symplectic/Contact Geometry VII at Les Diablerets, Day 1 :geometry:topology:

I'm currently in Switzerland at the seventh [[http://members.unine.ch/felix.schlenk/CASTmeeting/index.html]["Symplectic Geometry,
Contact Geometry and Interactions"]] Workshop funded by [[http://cast.ulb.ac.be/][CAST]]. This is a
yearly conference which started at the same time I started my PhD so I
have a great fondness for these workshops. This one is in the
mountains, which makes me even fonder...

[[../img/mountain.jpg]]

After three excellent talks today I decided to act as a "maths
journalist" and summarise the main ideas from the talks in this
blog. I may not be able to keep this up, as there's six talks tomorrow
and too much snow to enjoy. Today's talks were:

- Urs Frauenfelder "A $\Gamma$-structure on the Lagrangian Grassmannian"
- Yochay Jerby "The symplectic topology of projective manifolds with
  small dual"
- Alex Ritter "Floer theory for negative line bundles"

* Why Schrödinger's equation? 					    :quantum:

[2012-11-05 Mon]

"Why this equation?"

I recently overheard someone ask this about Schrödinger's
equation. The answer they received was, for me, unsatisfying. "Because
it agrees with experiment." Of course, that answers perfectly why the
equation was adopted by future generations of physicists and indeed
the calculation of the spectrum of atomic hydrogen from the energy
eigenvalues of the Schrödinger operator is one of the most convincing
and wholesome computations a young physicist can do. But the question
that was left unanswered, the question I believe was being asked, was:
"Why did Schrödinger write this equation down? Why not something
else?" I don't believe for a second that Schrödinger sat down with an
array of different equations and worked out what each of them
predicted about hydrogen before he found the one that fit...

* HEA course for new maths lecturers 				   :teaching:

[2012-09-18 Tue]

Last week I had the pleasure of attending a course for new maths
lecturers run by the [[http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/disciplines/maths-stats-or][Maths, Stats and Operations Research discipline
of the Higher Education Academy (HEA/MSOR)]]. I was pleased that it
dispelled several myths for me, in particular the myth that these
courses never cater for mathematicians' needs. All the talks were
given by experienced mathematics lecturers or people who have spent a
considerable amount of time undertaking educational research specific
to university-level maths. With such good quality input, and with the
high level of engagement discussion amongst the participants, I
learned a lot.

* Lines through four lines 					   :geometry:
  
[2012-08-14 Tue]

(Reposting this from an earlier blog which I gave up on, but liked the
post so I added some pictures – all images produced using the amazing
free alternative to Maple/Mathematica, Sage).

I was reading Fulton-Pandharipande ("Notes on stable maps and quantum
cohomology") the other day and came across the classical result that
there are exactly two lines passing through a generic quadruple of
lines in $\mathbf{CP}^3$. I encourage people to whom this fact is
unfamiliar to convince themselves of it. It was unfamiliar to me and I
found it hard to visualise, so I sat down and drew some pictures until
I understood it.

* Quantum computers: Grover's algorithm 			    :quantum:

[2013-08-13 Tue]

I've been meaning to get my head around the idea of a quantum computer
for a while now and, since my mathematical energy is currently reduced
to clearing out my ETH office, I thought I'd do some reading and find
out more. I leafed through my dusty copy of Wikipedia, picked up
Kitaev et al from the library and turned to chapter two...

I think the easiest way to illustrate how a quantum computer differs
(functionally) from a classical computer is by explaining an algorithm
which only makes sense for quantum computers and which really
outperforms a classical algorithm for the same task (that is the point
of quantum computers, after all). The first algorithm they explain in
Kitaev et al is called Grover's algorithm and it performs the task of
searching a database. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover’s_algorithm][Wikipedia]] has a really nice exposition too, but
I was initially confused by what they both call a "quantum oracle"
(sounds like something from Star Trek TNG). I tried to explicitly
avoid that in what I said below.

*TLDR:* Classically you have to look through all $N$ elements of a
database until you find the right one (so runtime increases linearly
in N); Grover's algorithm has a surprising runtime of order $\sqrt{N}$
to do the same thing, using clever ideas from quantum mechanics.
