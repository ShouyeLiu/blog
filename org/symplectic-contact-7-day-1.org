* Symplectic/Contact Geometry VII at Les Diablerets, Day 1

[2013-01-11 Fri]

I'm currently in Switzerland at the seventh [[http://members.unine.ch/felix.schlenk/CASTmeeting/index.html]["Symplectic Geometry,
Contact Geometry and Interactions"]] Workshop funded by [[http://cast.ulb.ac.be/][CAST]]. This is a
yearly conference which started at the same time I started my PhD so I
have a great fondness for these workshops. This one is in the
mountains, which makes me even fonder...

After three excellent talks today I decided to act as a "maths journalist" and summarise the main ideas from the talks in this blog. I may not be able to keep this up, as there's six talks tomorrow and too much snow to enjoy. Today's talks were:

- Urs Frauenfelder "A $\Gamma$-structure on the Lagrangian Grassmannian"
- Yochay Jerby "The symplectic topology of projective manifolds with
  small dual"
- Alex Ritter "Floer theory for negative line bundles"

** Urs Frauenfelder: A \Gamma-structure on the Lagrangian Grassmannian.

This was a great way to start the conference – an elementary talk
about the topology of one of our favourite spaces, the Lagrangian
Grassmannian. Of course, its cohomology has been known for a long time
(it's a homogeneous space $U(n)/O(n)$ and there are spectral sequence
techniques for computing such cohomology groups, see for example
Toda-Mimura's books on the topology of Lie groups) – in the case when
$n$ is odd the rational cohomology is an exterior algebra on odd
-degree generators. But the beauty of this talk was a simple geometric
explanation of why we should get an exterior algebra on odd
generators!

The key definition of a $\Gamma$-structure is due to Hopf (1941). It
generalises that of a Lie group multiplication $m\colon G\times G\to
G$. The essential topological fact about Lie group multipication maps
is that restricting to $\{g\}\times G$ or $G\times\{g\}$ (i.e. left- or
right-multiplication by $g$) gives you degree 1 maps $L_g,R_g\colon
G\to G$. Hopf defined a $\Gamma$-structure on an oriented, connected
manifold $M$ to be a map $\Theta\colon M\times M\to M$ such that the
restrictions $_m\Theta:=\Theta|_{\{m\}\times M}\colon M\to M$ and
$\Theta_m:=\Theta|_{M\times\{m\}}\colon M\to M$ both have nonzero
degree.

This structure gives us (via pullback) a coproduct $\Delta\colon
H^*(M;\mathbf{Q})\otimes H^*(M;\mathbf{Q})\to H^*(M;\mathbf{Q})$ on
the cohomology. This is enough to constrain the cohomology ring to
being an exterior algebra on odd-dimensional generators (an amazing
fact due to Hopf).

The $\Gamma$-structure on the Lagrangian Grassmannian is most evident
when you identify a Lagrangian subspace with the unique orthogonal
antisymplectic involution having it as fixed locus. Given two such
involutions $R,S$ you can form the "product" $RSR$ and this is the
$\Gamma$-structure (with degrees $-1$ and $2^{\frac{n-1}{2}}$). Urs
explained this carefully and clearly and I found it particularly
helpful to contemplate the instructive example $n=1$ (when the
Lagrangian Grassmannian is $\mathbf{RP}^1$).

** Yochay Jerby: The symplectic topology of projective varieties with small dual.

/(Joint with Paul Biran)/ See [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0174][arXiv:1107.0174]].

It always pleases me when someone proves a result in algebraic
geometry using symplectic techniques. This talk is a beautiful
example. The dual of projective space is the space of hyperplanes in
projective space (which is isomorphic to projective space). The dual
of a subvariety is the variety of hyperplanes containing the tangent
spaces of the subvariety. This is generically a hypersurface, but in
certain special cases it has higher codimension. For example, the dual
of a hyperplane is a point! These are called varieties with small dual
and Yochay was talking about smooth varieties $X$ with small dual.

These have been much studied by algebraic geometers and turn out to be
very special (for instance there are strong restrictions on their
topology, including a 2-periodicity of the cohomology in some range of
degrees). From a symplectic viewpoint they turn out to be special too:
Biran and Jerby take a hyperplane section $\Sigma$ and prove that the
cohomology class of the Fubini-Study form is invertible, considered as
an element of quantum cohomology of $\Sigma$. They do this by showing
that it arises as the Seidel element of a loop in the Hamiltonian
group. Loops in the Hamiltonian group can be used as clutching
functions to describe Hamiltonian fibrations over the sphere, and the
Hamiltonian fibration in this case comes very naturally from the
projective geometry: you take a line in the dual projective space
which is disjoint from the dual variety of $X$ (possible precisely
because $X$ has small dual!) and use these hyperplanes to cut out a
family of smooth hyperplane sections $\Sigma$ parametrised by this
line. The Seidel element associated to this fibration is then an
invertible element in quantum cohomology defined using some moduli
spaces of sections of the fibration and the main theorem is to compute
this and show it is indeed the cohomology class of the symplectic
form.

Having an invertible element in degree two means that the quantum
cohomology is 2-periodic, but it is also graded by the minimal Chern
number and using these two facts allows you to recover a refinement of
the classical 2-periodicity theorem of the cohomology of varieties
with small dual. Not only is the cohomology 2-periodic in some range
but outside that range there is a periodicity of the quantum
cohomology which translates into a periodicity of sums of Betti
numbers which was not known (I think) via purely algebro-geometric
techniques.

** Alex Ritter: Floer theory for negative line bundles.

/(Partly joint work with Ivan Smith)/ See [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3975][arXiv:1106.3975]] and [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5880][arXiv:1201.5880]].

Faced with the monumental task of introducing (wrapped and unwrapped)
Floer homology, symplectic homology and Fukaya categories as well as
telling us about his theorem (all in the final hour before dinner),
Alex rose to the challenge with a beautiful set of highly illustrated
beamer slides.

The spaces Alex was talking about are the total spaces of line bundles
over symplectic manifolds (mostly $\mathbf{CP}^n$) such that the first
Chern class is a negative multiple of the cohomology class of the
symplectic form. For instance, $\mathcal{O}(-1)$ over
$\mathbf{CP}^1$. These are noncompact symplectic manifolds with
symplectic fibres and symplectic base and they are convex in the sense
that a sequence of holomorphic curves cannot escape to infinity. The
first theorem he proved was that the symplectic homology of such a
space is a quotient of the quantum homology (symplectic homology is a
Floer theory counting periodic orbits of a Hamiltonian which gets very
big quite quickly in the noncompact end of the manifold, quantum
homology just counts compact holomorphic spheres!). In particular you
quotient by the kernel of a certain map: the quantum cup product with
a high power of the first Chern class. When there are no spheres with
positive symplectic area in the base (and hence in the total space)
the quantum and classical cup products agree and hence a sufficiently
large power of the first Chern class vanishes, to the whole quantum
cohomology is in its kernel, which recovers an older result of Oancea
(that assuming there are no spheres with positive symplectic area the
symplectic homology vanishes). The idea of the proof was the
following: symplectic homology is defined as a limit of Floer
homologies for a sequence of Hamitonians. For a suitable choice of
these Hamiltonians you can ensure that each of these Floer homologies
is isomorphic to quantum cohomology (roughly speaking you rotate the
fibre in such a way as to ensure that all closed orbits lie in the
zero section) and the maps in the sequence are precisely
multiplications by the first Chern class.

Not satisfied with this, Alex raised the stakes algebraically and
introduced the "open-closed string map" (one of the more complicated,
though increasingly central, aspects of the Fukaya/Floer story). This
is a map from the Hochschild cohomology of the Fukaya category to the
quantum homology. I think (hope) I'm right in saying the
following. For a single Lagrangian $L$ it takes a collection of cycles
("inputs" – the Hochschild cohomology having as its $n$th chain group
the tensor product of $n$ copies of the Floer chain group of $L$) to
an ambient cycle. The ambient cycle is traced out by a marked point on
a holomorphic disc with as many marked points as there are inputs
where each point point is required to be mapped to the corresponding
cycle. Mad. And then he raised the stakes yet more by introducing the
analogous map from the wrapped Fukaya category to the symplectic
homology.

Why? Well Abouzaid recently proved a criterion for when a Lagrangian
(or collection of Lagrangians) split-generates the Fukaya category (or
some part of it) by looking at the image of this open-closed string
map. Ritter and Smith have adapted this to the monotone setting they
need for these negative line bundles. Using this criterion (namely
that the image should contain some invertible element) they prove that
you only need a single Lagrangian to split-generate the wrapped Fukaya
category of a negative line bundle over $\mathbf{CP}^n$ (for suitably
low Chern class of the line bundle). The Lagrangian in question is the
circle bundle living over the Clifford torus (which, when taken with
various flat connections, generates all the various parts of the
Fukaya category). In particular, the wrapped category is generated by
a compact Lagrangian, so this proves that all the potential
infinite-dimensionality introduced by wrapped Floer cohomology is
actually only finite-dimensional (in the same way that the symplectic
cohomology reduced to a quotient of quantum cohomology).

At this point, Alex brought the discussion back down to earth by
discussing the equator in the sphere (one of the most instructive
Lagrangian submanifolds, well worth your contemplation). Then we went
for tea.
